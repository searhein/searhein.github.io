    abstract = {Schwarz methods are an algorithmic framework for a large class of domain decomposition methods. The software FROSch (Fast and Robust Overlapping Schwarz), which is part of the Trilinos package ShyLU, provides a highly scalable implementation of the Schwarz framework, and the resulting solvers are based on the construction and combination of the relevant Schwarz operators. FROSch currently focusses on Schwarz operators that are algebraic in the sense that they can be constructed from a fully assembled, parallel distributed matrix. This is facilitated by the use of extension-based coarse spaces, such as generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund (GDSW) type coarse spaces. In this lab session, the FROSch software framework will be introduced, and its usage will be explained based on simple model problems. The examples provided will allow investigating the influence of important algorithmic aspects of Schwarz methods, such as the variation of the width of the overlap or adding a coarse level, on the convergence of a preconditioned Krylov solver.},

    title = {Surrogate Models for Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations Using Convolutional Autoencoder Neural Networks and Physical Constraints},
    author = {Alexander Heinlein},
    year = {2021},
    abbr = {CIRM 2021},
    note = {CIRM Conference "Analysis, Control and Numerics for PDE Models of Interest to Physical and Life Sciences", Levico Terme, Italy, September 20-24, 2021},
    abstract = {Simulations of fluid flow are generally very costly because high grid resolutions are not only required to obtain quantitatively accurate results, but too low grid resolutions may also lead to qualitatively incorrect results. In applications, however, one is often not interested in accurate approximations of the complete flow field but only in the qualitative behavior of the flow or in individual quantities (e.g., maximum velocity, pressure drop within a section of a pipe, or wall shear stresses at certain locations). In this talk, the use of convolutional autoencoder neural networks to construct efficient reduced order surrogate models for high fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations is discussed; cf. [Eichinger et al., 2021] and [Eichinger et al., submitted 2020]. Using this approach, which is inspired by [Guo et al., 2016], it is possible to build surrogate models for varying geometries. In particular, the geometry is the input of the neural network, and the flow and pressure fields are the output. The proposed framework is very general since the geometry and solution fields are simply encoded as pixel images, which allows the application to various types of geometries; also the extension to other physics is, in principle, straight forward. In order to construct accurate surrogate models, U-Net [Ronneberger et al., 2015] type convolutional neural networks, which are very successful in image recognition and segmentation tasks, are employed and the architecture and hyper parameters are optimized to this application. As a first step, a fully supervised approach, which requires the availability of simulation results as the training data, is presented. Here, the choice of an appropriate loss function is crucial to obtain good results. After that, results for a newer unsupervised approach, which does not require CFD simulation results but is based on introducing physical constraints via the loss function. As a testbed for the surrogate models, the flow around obstacles with varying shape and size within a channel is considered. Moreover, results for the application to geometries of arteries with aneurysms are presented. In both cases, only two-dimensional configurations are considered for now. The results show that the surrogate models provide good predictions of the flow and pressure fields while being computationally much cheaper compared to classical CFD codes. In particular, the predictions can be performed on a workstation within a fraction of a second, without requiring the generation of a computational mesh. When evaluated on GPUs, the prediction time can be further reduced by factor of more than ten. The talk is based on joint work with Matthias Eichinger, Viktor Grimm, and Axel Klawonn (University of Cologne).},

    note = {YIC 2021 (Virtual), July 7-9, 2021},
    abstract = {FROSch (Fast and Robust Overlapping Schwarz) is a framework for parallel Schwarz domain decomposition preconditioners, which is part of Trilinos. Although being a general framework for the construction and combination of Schwarz operators, FROSch currently focusses on preconditioners that are algebraic in the sense that they can be constructed from a fully assembled, parallel distributed matrix. The computation of the first level is based on the construction of overlapping subdomains, which can be carried out based on the sparsity pattern of the matrix. In addition to that, robust and scalable coarse spaces are constructed from a partition of unity on the domain decomposition interface and energy-minimizing extensions, without the need for additional information. In particular, GDSW (Generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund) type coarse spaces are considered. In this talk, the use of inexact solvers for the local overlapping problems and the global coarse problem will be investigated. For this purpose, inexact solvers from different packages from the Trilinos framework will be employed, e.g, from Ifpack2, MueLu, or FROSch itself.},

We then study the coupled velocity and temperature problem for the Greenland ice sheet. To the best of our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst time that a scalable monolithic two-level preconditioner has been used for this multiphysics problem. We present strong scaling results, up to 4 k MPI ranks, using a monolithic GDSW type preconditioner with decoupled extensions from the FROSch package.},

    note = {91st GAMM Annual Meeting (Virtual), Kassel, Germany, March 15-19, 2021},
    abstract = {Stress distributions in walls of in vivo arteries (transmural stresses) are a major factor for the course of cardiac diseases; for instance, they are a driving force for the process of arteriosclerosis and arteriogenesis. In order to make accurate predictions of realistic stress distributions using numerical fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations, the use of appropriate material models for the arterial walls is essential. In the literature, a wide range of material models is used for this purpose. In this talk, several existing material models for arterial walls are compared based on the curved tube FSI benchmark. In the benchmark configuration, the geometry corresponds to a bended idealized coronary artery with only one material layer. Furthermore, two phases are considered: first, the artery is brought to a physiological pressure of 80 mmHg, and second, the inflow profile of one heartbeat is imposed. As material models, linear elasticity, isotropic hyperelasticity, i.e., a Neo-Hookean material model, as well as the nonlinear anisotropic hyperelastic material models are taken into account. Numerical results for both linear elasticity and Neo-Hookean material models differ significantly from the results obtained with nonlinear anisotropic hyperelastic material models, which have been fitted to experimental data of real arteries. Moreover, the performance of the parallel FSI simulations using different material models is investigated.},

Even though, the training of a neural network is expensive, its evaluation is quite cheap compared to fully resolved Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. This results in a multitude of application possibilities for neural networks in this context, especially in time critical settings.},
