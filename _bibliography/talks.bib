    abstract = {Coarse spaces are an important component in domain decomposition preconditioners since they are, in general, necessary to obtain numerical scalability and robustness. This talk will focus on presenting an algorithmic framework for the construction of coarse spaces for Schwarz preconditioners which is based on the generalized Dryja--Smith--Widlund (GDSW) coarse space. In particular, the coarse basis functions are extensions from the interface into the interior of a corresponding nonoverlapping domain decomposition by solving the homogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) with a given trace on the interface. This makes the coarse spaces very practical since they can be constructed in an algebraic way, that is, using only the fully assembled system matrix. This algorithmic framework is the basis for the highly-scalable FROSch (Fast and Robust Schwarz) solver package, which is part of the Trilinos software library. The FROSch package provides a parallel software framework to construct algebraic Schwarz preconditioners that are robust as well as numerically and parallel scalable for a wide range of problems. It provides a multi-level implementation to extend parallel scalability. Moreover, using extension-based coarse spaces, robust monolithic solvers for saddle-point problems, such as the (Navier--)Stokes equations and multi-physics problems in land ice simulations, can be constructed. Solving appropriate local eigenvalue problems on a partition of the interface to compute the traces of the coarse basis yields provably robust extension-based coarse spaces, even for highly heterogeneous model problems with large coefficient jumps. These adaptive coarse spaces are generally not algebraic since the eigenvalue problems require local Neumann matrices. However, by solving two local eigenvalue problems for each interface component instead, an algebraic and adaptive coarse space can be obtained. Finally, the framework can also be employed in nonlinear Schwarz preconditioning.},

    title = {Robust Coarse Spaces for Nonlinear Schwarz Methods},
    author = {Alexander Heinlein},

    note = {27th International Conference on Domain Decomposition Methods, Prague, Czech Republic, July 25-29},
    abstract = {In this talk, nonlinear left-preconditioning by nonlinear Schwarz domain decomposition methods is considered. In particular, the focus is on the restricted additive Schwarz preconditioned exact Newton (RASPEN) method. It is based on additive Schwarz preconditioned Newton (ASPEN) method, which has been introduced together with the corresponding inexact method, ASPIN. Nonlinear domain decomposition methods can improve nonlinear as well as linear convergence. However, as in linear domain decomposition methods, scalability and robustness for difficult problems, such as highly heterogeneous problems, generally requires adding a coarse space. The coarse space can be integrated in an additive or multiplicative way using a Galerkin projection, as described in [5]. This approach has proven to be very flexible, allowing for the use of different types of coarse spaces, such as classical Lagrangian or multiscale finite element method (MsFEM) type coarse spaces. Furthermore, to obtain robustness for heterogeneous problems, spectral coarse spaces, such as the adaptive generalized Dryja–Smith–Wildund (GDSW) coarse space can be employed. The main goal of this talk is to investigate the effectiveness of different coarse spaces, including GDSW, MsFEM, adaptive GDSW, and approximate component mode synthesis-based (OS-ACMS) adaptive coarse spaces for different nonlinear model problems and depending on the domain decomposition as well as heterogeneity of the problem.},

    abstract = {Simulations of fluid flow are generally very costly because high grid resolutions are not only required to obtain quantitatively accurate results, but too low grid resolutions may also lead to qualitatively incorrect results. In applications, however, one is often not interested in accurate approximations of the complete flow field but only in the qualitative behavior of the flow or in individual quantities (e.g., maximum velocity, pressure drop within a section of a pipe, or wall shear stresses at certain locations). In this talk, the use of convolutional autoencoder neural networks to construct efficient reduced order surrogate models for high fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations is discussed. Using this approach, it is possible to build surrogate models for varying geometries. In particular, the geometry is the input of the neural network, and the flow and pressure fields are the output. In order to construct accurate surrogate models, U-Net type convolutional neural networks, which are very successful in image recognition and segmentation tasks, are employed and the architecture and hyper parameters are optimized to this application. As a first step, a fully supervised approach, which requires the availability of simulation results as the training data, is presented. After that, a novel approach is introduced, which does not require CFD simulation results but is based on introducing physical constraints via the loss function. As a test-bed for the surrogate models, flow around obstacles with varying shape and size within a channel is considered. Moreover, results for the application to geometries of arteries with aneurysms are presented. The results show that the surrogate models provide good predictions of the flow and pressure fields while being computationally much cheaper compared to classical CFD codes.},

    abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are important in many application areas, such as civil and mechanical engineering, meteorology, geosciences, or medical science. However, accurate simulation results come at high computational costs, and they require high-quality meshes describing the computational domain. In this talk, a machine learning-based model order reduction approach for predicting flow fields is presented. After an expensive offline phase, where a surrogate model based on a convolutional neural network (U-Net type architecture) is trained using simulation data, the predictions can be performed much faster than classical numerical simulations. Moreover, the predictions do not require the generation of a complex computational mesh. The surrogate model can be 10^2 or 10^4 times faster on a CPU or GPU, respectively, of a normal workstation. Numerical results investigating the accuracy and efficiency for varying types of geometries from different application areas are presented. Moreover, different aspects to improve the performance such as the choice of more sophisticated loss functions are discussed.},

We use one-level Schwarz preconditioners as well as GDSW (Generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund) type preconditioners from the Trilinos package FROSch (Fast and Robust Schwarz), scaling up to 32 k processor cores (8 k MPI ranks and 4 OpenMP threads) for the ﬁnest Antarctica mesh; the corresponding velocity problem contains 566 M degrees of freedom. We then study the coupled velocity and temperature problem for the Greenland ice sheet. To the best of our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst time that a scalable monolithic two-level preconditioner has been used for this multiphysics problem. We present strong scaling results, up to 4 k MPI ranks, using a monolithic GDSW type preconditioner with decoupled extensions from the FROSch package.},

    abstract = {Stress distributions in walls of in vivo arteries (transmural stresses) are a major factor for the course of cardiac diseases; for instance, they are a driving force for the process of arteriosclerosis and arteriogenesis. In order to make accurate predictions of realistic stress distributions using numerical fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations, the use of appropriate material models for the arterial walls is essential. In the literature, a wide range of material models is used for this purpose. In this talk, several existing material models for arterial walls are compared based on the curved tube FSI benchmark. In the benchmark configuration, the geometry corresponds to a bended idealized coronary artery with only one material layer. Furthermore, two phases are considered: first, the artery is brought to a physiological pressure of 80 mmHg, and second, the inflow profile of one heartbeat is imposed. As material models, linear elasticity, isotropic hyperelasticity, i.e., a Neo-Hookean material model, as well as the nonlinear anisotropic hyperelastic material models are taken into account. Numerical results for both linear elasticity and Neo-Hookean material models differ significantly from the results obtained with nonlinear anisotropic hyperelastic material models, which have been fitted to experimental data of real arteries. Moreover, the performance of the parallel FSI simulations using different material models is investigated.},

    abstract = {FROSch (Fast and Robust Overlapping Schwarz) is a framework for parallel Schwarz domain decomposition preconditioners, which is part of the Trilinos package ShyLU. Although being a general framework for the construction and combination of Schwarz operators, FROSch currently focusses on preconditioners that are algebraic in the sense that they can be constructed from a fully assembled, parallel distributed matrix. This is facilitated by the use of extension based coarse spaces, such as GDSW (Generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund) type coarse spaces. This talk will cover several Schwarz preconditioning techniques which are currently being developed based on the FROSch package: reduced dimension coarse spaces, multilevel GDSW coarse spaces, and monolithic preconditioners for block systems. These approaches are introduced and applied to different problems ranging from a Poisson equation to a coupled multi physics simulations of land ice in Antarctica. Furthermore, a brief overview of some related Schwarz preconditioning techniques, which are not implemented in FROSch yet, will be given. This includes nonlinear two-level Schwarz preconditioning techniques based on Galerkin projections, adaptive coarse spaces for highly heterogeneous problems, as well as the application of machine learning techniques in order to improve the efficiency of these adaptive coarse spaces.},

    abstract = {Simulations of fluid flow are generally very costly because too low grid resolutions may even lead to qualitatively incorrect solutions. In applications, however, one is often not interested in accurate approximations of the complete flow field but only in the qualitative behavior of the flow or in individual quantities (e.g., maximum velocity, pressure drop within a section of a pipe, or wall shear stresses at certain locations). In this talk, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict fluid flow fields is investigated. Therefore, U-Net [Ronneberger et al., 2015] type convolutional neural networks, which are successfully used for image recognition and segmentation tasks, are applied in this context. As a model problem, the flow around obstacles with varying shape and size within a channel is considered. Obstacles of certain type are used as training data, and the generalization of the models to other obstacle geometries and sizes is analyzed. Even though, the training of a neural network is expensive, its evaluation is quite cheap compared to fully resolved Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. This results in a multitude of application possibilities for neural networks in this context, especially in time critical settings.},
