    note = {Invited seminar talk. CASA colloquium, TU Eindhoven, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, November 20},
    abstract = {Domain decomposition methods (DDMs) solve boundary value problems by decomposing them into smaller subproblems defined on an overlapping or non-overlapping decomposition of the computational domain. Their divide-and-conquer approach makes DDMs well-suited for large-scale problems and parallel computing. However, achieving robust convergence for challenging problems and scalability to large numbers of subdomains generally requires (global) information transport. This can be achieved by incorporating well-designed coarse levels, transforming DDMs from one- into multi-level algorithms. This talk highlights the importance of using multiple levels in domain decomposition methods. In the first part of the talk, coarse spaces for domain decomposition-based preconditioners will be discussed. They can provide robustness and scalability to Schwarz preconditioners for a wide range of challenging problems exhibiting, for instance, strong heterogeneities, multiple coupled physics, and/or strong nonlinearities. Numerical results using the FROSch (Fast and Robust Overlapping Schwarz) package, which is part of the Trilinos library, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of these Schwarz preconditioners. The second part of the talk will explore the application of DDMs to neural networks (NNs), demonstrating improvements in terms of accuracy, computation time, and/or memory efficiency. Similar to classical domain decomposition methods, coarse levels, here in the form of small global NNs, ensure global information transport, enabling scalability. This talk will cover the application of DDMs in solving partial differential equations using physics-informed NNs (PINNs) and in image segmentation using convolutional NNs (CNNs).},

    abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a class of methods for solving differential equation-based problems using a neural network as the discretization. PINNs have been introduced by Raissi et al. and combine the pioneering collocation approach for neural network functions introduced by Lagaris et al. with the incorporation of data via an additional loss term. PINNs are very versatile as they do not require an explicit mesh, allow for the solution of parameter identification problems, and are well-suited for high-dimensional problems. However, the training of a PINN model is generally not very robust and may require careful hyper parameter tuning. In particular, due to the so-called spectral bias, the training of PINN models is notoriously difficult when scaling up to large computational domains as well as for multiscale problems. In this talk, overlapping domain decomposition-based techniques for PINNs are being discussed. One way to incorporate the domain decomposition approach is to introduce an outer Schwarz iteration and solve the local subdomain problems using a PINN model. This approach has been introduced as the deep learning-based domain decomposition (DeepDDM) method. On the other hand, in the finite basis physics-informed neural networks (FBPINNs) approach, the domain decomposition is introduced via the network architecture, and the coupling is performed implicitly without introducing additional loss terms. Inspired by the space decomposition of classical Schwarz methods, a general framework, that also allows for multilevel extensions, can be introduced. The multilevel FBPINN method outperforms classical PINNs on several types of problems, including multiscale problems, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the combination of the multilevel domain decomposition strategy with multifidelity stacking PINNs, introduced as stacking FBPINNs for time-dependent problems, will be discussed. It can be observed that the combination of multifidelity stacking PINNs with a domain decomposition in time clearly improves the reference results without a domain decomposition.},

This is facilitated by the use of extension-based coarse spaces, such as generalized Dryja-Smith-Wildund (GDSW) type coarse spaces. This talk gives an overview of the FROSch software framework and summarizes current developments.},

    abstract = {FROSch (Fast and Robust Overlapping Schwarz) is a framework for parallel Schwarz domain decomposition preconditioners in Trilinos. It is applicable to a wide range of problems due to its algebraic approach, which allows the preconditioners to be constructed from a fully assembled, parallel distributed matrix. This is enabled by the use of extension-based coarse spaces instead of classical coarse spaces. FROSch also features a variety of algorithmic variants that extend its applicability and scalability. These include monolithic preconditioning for block systems and multi-level extensions. This talk will focus on recent developments in FROSch that improve the efficiency of Schwarz preconditioners for current hardware architectures. These include techniques for reducing communication and global work, lower precision preconditioning, as well as techniques for facilitating GPUs. The performance of the different techniques will be demonstrated for different application problems and using different state-of-the-art supercomputers.},

    abstract = {Monolithic GDSW (generalized Dryja–Smith–Wildund) preconditioners are scalable two-level Schwarz preconditioners for block systems. Compared with block domain decomposition preconditioners, monolithic domain decomposition preconditioners often yield faster convergence since they account for the coupling within the subdomain and coarse problems. In this talk, the focus is on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, in particular, saddle point problem resulting from the discretization of the (Navier-)Stokes equations. In this case, numerical results show that fast convergence and scalability of monolithic Schwarz preconditioners strongly depends on the choice of an appropriate pair of the velocity and pressure coarse spaces; in particular, there seem to be parallels to inf-sup stable discretizations. Whereas inf-sup stable Lagrangian coarse spaces, for instance, based on Taylor-Hood elements, yield scalable monolithic preconditioners, they are limited in their applicability to complicated geometries and unstructured domain decompositions. GDSW-type coarse spaces are well-suited for those cases, but, in general, an extension of the GDSW approach is required to construct appropriate pairs of velocity and pressure coarse spaces. Therefore, in this talk, a wider class of extension-based coarse spaces using various interface partitions of unity is explored. The numerical and parallel scalability for (Navier-)Stokes problems is then investigated using the parallel FROSch (Fast and Robust Overlapping Schwarz) preconditioner framework in Trilinos.},

    abstract = {This talk discusses several techniques for efficiently solving nonlinear problems using Schwarz methods. Newton-Krylov methods are widely used to solve nonlinear problems numerically. These methods linearize the system using Newton's method and solve the resulting linearized systems using a (preconditioned) Krylov method. When using domain decomposition preconditioners, the efficiency can be enhanced if information about the preconditioner from previous linearizations is reused. This includes structural information, such as the domain decomposition, certain index sets, and symbolic factorizations of the subdomain and coarse problems, but also certain components of the preconditioner, such as the coarse space. This typically leads to a speedup in the setup phase, resulting in a dominance of the time required for the solve phase; the solve phase can then be sped up by assign computations to GPUs. As an alternative to Newton-Krylov methods, nonlinear Schwarz preconditioning techniques can be employed to speed up both the nonlinear and linear convergence. In order to facilitate numerical scalability to large numbers of subdomains, a multi-level approach has to be employed; this leads to nonlinear multi-level Schwarz methods. The aforementioned approaches are being discussed and investigated in numerical experiments.},

    abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are highly relevant for a large range of applications, including but not restricted to the fields of aerospace, environmental, and biological engineering as well as weather predictions and medicine. Modeling Newtonian fluids involves the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, which, depending on the Reynolds number of the flow, may exhibit a highly nonlinear behavior. The system of nonlinear equations resulting from the discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations can be solved using nonlinear iteration methods, such as Newton’s method. However, fast quadratic convergence is typically only obtained in a local neighborhood of the solution, and for many configurations, the classical Newton iteration does not converge at all. In such cases, so-called globalization techniques may help to improve convergence. In this talk, pseudo-transient continuation is employed in order to improve nonlinear convergence. The classical algorithm is enhanced by a neural network model that is trained to predict a local pseudo-time step. Generalization of the novel approach is facilitated by predicting the local pseudo-time step separately on each element using only local information on a patch of adjacent elements as input. Numerical results for standard benchmark problems, including flow through a backward facing step geometry and Couette flow, show the performance of the machine learning-enhanced globalization approach; as the software for the simulations, the CFD module of COMSOL Multiphysics® is employed.},

A resolution of the fast (micro) scale over this period can easily require more than a billion time steps, each corresponding to the solution of a computationally expensive FSI problem. To tackle this problem, we combine a temporal homogenization approach with parallel time-stepping. First, a temporal homogenization approach is developed, which separates the problem in an FSI problem on the micro scale and a reaction-diffusion problem on the macro scale. The approach is analyzed in detail for a simplified flow problem and estimates for the homogenization error and the discretization errors on both time scales are given. Second, a parallel time-stepping approach based on the parareal algorithm is applied on the macro scale of the homogenized system. We investigate modifications in the coarse propagator of the parareal algorithm to further reduce the number of expensive micro problems to be solved and test the numerical algorithms in detailed numerical studies.},

They are robust because they account for the coupling terms in the system matrix on both levels, that is, in the local and coarse problems. Block preconditioners, mostly based on block-diagonal and block-triangular preconditioners, such as the famous SIMPLE (semi-implicit method for pressure linked equations) preconditioner, often yield higher iteration counts wile coming at a lower setup cost compared to monolithic approaches. In this talk, the parallel performance of the different preconditioning techniques for incompressible fluid flow problems is investigated and compared using a finite element implementation based on the FEDDLib finite element software and Schwarz preconditioners from the Trilinos package FROSch.},

However, accurate simulation results come at high computational costs, and they require high-quality meshes describing the computational domain. In this talk, a machine learning-based model order reduction approach for predicting flow fields is presented. After an expensive offline phase, where a surrogate model based on a convolutional neural network (U-Net type architecture) is trained using simulation data, the predictions can be performed much faster than classical numerical simulations. Moreover, the predictions do not require the generation of a complex computational mesh. The surrogate model can be 100 or 10,000 times faster on a CPU or GPU, respectively, of a normal workstation. Numerical results investigating the accuracy and efficiency for varying types of geometries from different application areas are presented. Moreover, different aspects to improve the performance such as the choice of more sophisticated loss functions are discussed.},

    abstract = {Coarse spaces are an important component in domain decomposition preconditioners since they are, in general, necessary to obtain numerical scalability and robustness. This talk will focus on presenting an algorithmic framework for the construction of coarse spaces for Schwarz preconditioners which is based on the generalized Dryja--Smith--Widlund (GDSW) coarse space. In particular, the coarse basis functions are extensions from the interface into the interior of a corresponding nonoverlapping domain decomposition by solving the homogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) with a given trace on the interface. This makes the coarse spaces very practical since they can be constructed in an algebraic way, that is, using only the fully assembled system matrix. This algorithmic framework is the basis for the highly-scalable FROSch (Fast and Robust Schwarz) solver package, which is part of the Trilinos software library. The FROSch package provides a parallel software framework to construct algebraic Schwarz preconditioners that are robust as well as numerically and parallel scalable for a wide range of problems. It provides a multi-level implementation to extend parallel scalability. Moreover, using extension-based coarse spaces, robust monolithic solvers for saddle-point problems, such as the (Navier--)Stokes equations and multi-physics problems in land ice simulations, can be constructed. Solving appropriate local eigenvalue problems on a partition of the interface to compute the traces of the coarse basis yields provably robust extension-based coarse spaces, even for highly heterogeneous model problems with large coefficient jumps. These adaptive coarse spaces are generally not algebraic since the eigenvalue problems require local Neumann matrices. However, by solving two local eigenvalue problems for each interface component instead, an algebraic and adaptive coarse space can be obtained. Finally, the framework can also be employed in nonlinear Schwarz preconditioning.},

Recently there have been a number of attempts to speed up this process using neural networks. Among these is the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as surrogate models for CFD simulations with varying geometries. Here, the model is trained on images of high-fidelity simulation results. However, the generation of training data is expensive and this approach usually requires a large data set. Thus, it is of interest to be able to train a CNN in the absence of abundant training data with the help of physical constraints. First results have already been achieved for the heat equation on a fixed geometry and flow problems in parameterizable geometries. In this talk, we present a physics-aware approach to train CNNs as surrogate models for CFD simulations in varying geometries. The employed CNN takes an imags of the geometry as input and returns images of the associated CFD simulation results, i.e., velocity and pressure, as output. Our CNN architecture is based on the structure of U-Net. Since the model is trained on pixel images, it can be applied to a variety of different geometries. We show results for two-dimensional flows around obstacles of varying size and placement and in non-rectangular geometries, esp. arteries and aneurysms.},

In particular, the focus is on the restricted additive Schwarz preconditioned exact Newton (RASPEN) method. It is based on additive Schwarz preconditioned Newton (ASPEN) method, which has been introduced together with the corresponding inexact method, ASPIN. Nonlinear domain decomposition methods can improve nonlinear as well as linear convergence. However, as in linear domain decomposition methods, scalability and robustness for difficult problems, such as highly heterogeneous problems, generally requires adding a coarse space. The coarse space can be integrated in an additive or multiplicative way using a Galerkin projection. This approach has proven to be very flexible, allowing for the use of different types of coarse spaces, such as classical Lagrangian or multiscale finite element method (MsFEM) type coarse spaces. Furthermore, to obtain robustness for heterogeneous problems, spectral coarse spaces, such as the adaptive generalized Dryja–Smith–Wildund (GDSW) coarse space can be employed. The main goal of this talk is to investigate the effectiveness of different coarse spaces, including GDSW, MsFEM, adaptive GDSW, and approximate component mode synthesis-based (OS-ACMS) adaptive coarse spaces for different nonlinear model problems and depending on the domain decomposition as well as heterogeneity of the problem.},

    abstract = {Simulations of fluid flow are generally very costly because high grid resolutions are not only required to obtain quantitatively accurate results, but too low grid resolutions may also lead to qualitatively incorrect results. In applications, however, one is often not interested in accurate approximations of the complete flow field but only in the qualitative behavior of the flow or in individual quantities (e.g., maximum velocity, pressure drop within a section of a pipe, or wall shear stresses at certain locations). In this talk, the use of convolutional autoencoder neural networks to construct efficient reduced order surrogate models for high fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations is discussed. Using this approach, it is possible to build surrogate models for varying geometries. In particular, the geometry is the input of the neural network, and the flow and pressure fields are the output. In order to construct accurate surrogate models, U-Net type convolutional neural networks, which are very successful in image recognition and segmentation tasks, are employed and the architecture and hyper parameters are optimized to this application. As a first step, a fully supervised approach, which requires the availability of simulation results as the training data, is presented. After that, a novel approach is introduced, which does not require CFD simulation results but is based on introducing physical constraints via the loss function. As a test-bed for the surrogate models, flow around obstacles with varying shape and size within a channel is considered. Moreover, results for the application to geometries of arteries with aneurysms are presented. The results show that the surrogate models provide good predictions of the flow and pressure fields while being computationally much cheaper compared to classical CFD codes.},

    abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are important in many application areas, such as civil and mechanical engineering, meteorology, geosciences, or medical science. However, accurate simulation results come at high computational costs, and they require high-quality meshes describing the computational domain. In this talk, a machine learning-based model order reduction approach for predicting flow fields is presented. After an expensive offline phase, where a surrogate model based on a convolutional neural network (U-Net type architecture) is trained using simulation data, the predictions can be performed much faster than classical numerical simulations. Moreover, the predictions do not require the generation of a complex computational mesh. The surrogate model can be 10^2 or 10^4 times faster on a CPU or GPU, respectively, of a normal workstation. Numerical results investigating the accuracy and efficiency for varying types of geometries from different application areas are presented. Moreover, different aspects to improve the performance such as the choice of more sophisticated loss functions are discussed.},

In order to make accurate predictions of realistic stress distributions using numerical fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations, the use of appropriate material models for the arterial walls is essential. In the literature, a wide range of material models is used for this purpose. In this talk, several existing material models for arterial walls are compared based on the curved tube FSI benchmark. In the benchmark configuration, the geometry corresponds to a bended idealized coronary artery with only one material layer. Furthermore, two phases are considered: first, the artery is brought to a physiological pressure of 80 mmHg, and second, the inflow profile of one heartbeat is imposed. As material models, linear elasticity, isotropic hyperelasticity, i.e., a Neo-Hookean material model, as well as the nonlinear anisotropic hyperelastic material models are taken into account. Numerical results for both linear elasticity and Neo-Hookean material models differ significantly from the results obtained with nonlinear anisotropic hyperelastic material models, which have been fitted to experimental data of real arteries. Moreover, the performance of the parallel FSI simulations using different material models is investigated.},

Therefore, U-Net [Ronneberger et al., 2015] type convolutional neural networks, which are successfully used for image recognition and segmentation tasks, are applied in this context. As a model problem, the flow around obstacles with varying shape and size within a channel is considered. Obstacles of certain type are used as training data, and the generalization of the models to other obstacle geometries and sizes is analyzed. Even though, the training of a neural network is expensive, its evaluation is quite cheap compared to fully resolved Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. This results in a multitude of application possibilities for neural networks in this context, especially in time critical settings.},
