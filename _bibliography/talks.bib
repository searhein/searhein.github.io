This talk presents recent advances in domain decomposition (DD) for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and physics-informed deep neural operators (PI-DeepONets). While PINNs offer a flexible, mesh-free framework for high-dimensional, nonlinear problems, they suffer from ill-conditioning, limited training robustness, and scalability challenges. We show how DD yields scalable PINN architectures that improve convergence and training robustness. We further show that DD-enhanced PI-DeepONets efficiently and accurately approximate solution operators for parameterized problems. Numerical experiments on multiscale and wave-propagation problems illustrate the scalability and performance benefits of domain decomposition in physics-informed learning.},

    abstract = {Operator learning uses machine learning to approximate maps between function spaces, for instance, solution operators of initial--boundary value problems. Prominent neural operator architectures include Fourier neural operators (FNOs) [1] and Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) [2]. This talk covers data-driven and physics-informed training, focusing on DeepONets because they incorporate physics-informed loss terms in a straight-forward manner [3]. The DeepONet architecture couples a branch net that encodes the input function, that is, the problem parametrization of initial--boundary value problems, with a trunk net that learns spatio-temporal basis functions to represent the approximate solutions. The two networks are combined via a dot product. Training can be challenging and often requires extensive data. In this talk, we discuss (i) how DeepONets approximate solutions and how branch and trunk nets contribute to the error in data-driven training, and (ii) how localization via domain decomposition enhances fine-scale learning in physics-informed settings. We present numerical experiments on model problems to illustrate these aspects.},

    abstract = {Operator learning refers to the use of machine learning to approximate operators, that is, maps between function spaces. A typical example is learning the solution operator of initial-boundary value problems. When neural networks are used for this purpose, the resulting models are known as neural operators. Arguably the most prominent neural operator architectures are Fourier neural operators (FNOs), introduced by Li et al. (2020), and deep operator networks (DeepONets), introduced by Lu et al. (2019). This talk focuses on both data-driven and physics-informed training of neural operators. Therefore, the focus is on DeepONets, as they naturally allow for incorporating physics-informed loss terms; see Goswami et al. (2022). The DeepONet architecture consists of two neural networks: the branch net, which encodes the parametrization of the initial-boundary value problem, and the trunk net, which learns spatio-temporal features (or basis functions) to represent the solution. These networks are combined via a dot product to form the DeepONet output. Training DeepONets can be challenging and often requires a large amount of data. The presentation addresses two main topics. First, it investigates how DeepONets approximate solutions and the contributions of the branch and trunk networks to the overall error, particularly in data-driven training. Second, it investigates how localization through domain decomposition can enhance the learning of fine-scale features, especially in physics-informed training. Numerical experiments on model problems are presented to illustrate these aspects.},

    abstract = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a flexible, mesh-free approach to solving differential equations using neural networks. While their implementation is straightforward, training remains challenging due to sensitivity to weight initialization and hyperparameter selection. Additionally, issues such as scalability, spectral bias, and ill-conditioning pose significant challenges. This talk explores how overlapping domain decomposition (DD) techniques can improve the convergence and efficiency of PINNs. Three primary cases are investigated. First, classical PINNs are discussed, where solutions to specific initial-boundary value problems are approximated using standard feedforward neural networks. To enhance performance, DD-based architectures are introduced. Second, randomized neural networks are considered, where hidden layer weights are randomly initialized and fixed, leaving only the final layer to be trained. For linear differential operators, this approach reduces the problem to a linear least-squares formulation, which can be efficiently solved using classical numerical techniques. In this context, DD-based architectures are implemented alongside overlapping Schwarz preconditioning to accelerate convergence. Finally, improvements in physics-informed neural operators through DD-based architectures are studied. Unlike solving a single initial-boundary value problem, neural operators approximate solution operators for parameterized problems. Numerical experiments conducted on various model problems, including multiscale and wave phenomena, demonstrate the effectiveness of domain decomposition techniques for enhancing PINNs. These results highlight the potential of DD methods to improve computational efficiency and accuracy in physics-informed machine learning.},

Several strategies have been implemented to address these challenges, including the construction of monolithic and spectral coarse spaces that capture the structure of the underlying physical models. In addition, enhancements to the communication patterns between consecutive levels of the multilevel hierarchy have been implemented, reducing overhead and improving scalability on parallel architectures. The talk concludes with perspectives on the integration of machine learning techniques—such as graph neural networks—for the data-driven construction of coarse basis functions. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these advances in multiscale and multiphysics simulations, with applications in computational fluid dynamics, land ice modeling, and highly heterogeneous domains.},

    abstract = {Surrogate models—machine learning models designed to approximate complex and computationally expensive numerical simulations—are a central topic in scientific machine learning. These models are especially relevant for parametrized problems, where the goal is to predict solutions across a range of parameter configurations. While much existing research focuses on low-dimensional parameterizations, such as constant material properties, high-dimensional parameterizations—spatially or temporally varying initial or boundary conditions, material distributions, or source terms—introduce significant methodological and computational challenges. Notably, these cases offer even greater potential benefits, making them particularly important. This talk focuses on the spatial and temporal challenges of machine learning-based surrogate modeling. We examine difficulties in training such models for problems with complex features, including variable geometries and multiscale structures. Key topics include convolutional neural network-based surrogate models tailored to complex domains, adaptive sampling strategies to improve learning efficiency, and the use of spatio-temporal domain decomposition to enhance the scalability and accuracy of operator-based approaches. Applications in multiscale and wave-dominated phenomena, as well as computational fluid dynamics, will illustrate the effectiveness and potential of these methods.},

In this work, we apply this approach to randomized neural networks (RaNNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs).

Unlike classical PINNs, only the final layers of these networks are trained, which strongly impacts the resulting optimization problem. The resulting optimization problem, for linear PDEs, reduces to a least-squares formulation, which can be solved using direct solvers for small systems or iterative solvers for larger ones. However, the least-squares problems are generally ill-conditioned, and iterative solvers converge slowly without appropriate preconditioning. To address this, we first apply singular value decomposition (SVD) to remove components with low singular values, improving the conditioning of the system. Additionally, we employ a second type of overlapping domain decomposition in the form of additive and restricted additive Schwarz preconditioners for the least-squares problem, further enhancing solver efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this dual use of domain decomposition significantly reduces computational time while maintaining accuracy, particularly for multi-scale and time-dependent problems.},

Overlapping Schwarz DDMs are particularly effective for complex problems.

The FROSch (Fast and Robust Overlapping Schwarz) package, part of the Trilinos library, implements algebraic domain decomposition methods (DDMs). These methods require only the fully assembled system matrix and minimal geometric information, making them versatile for various applications. The construction of FROSch solvers begins with a non-overlapping domain decomposition obtained via graph partitioning, expanding into overlapping subdomains based on the system matrix's sparsity pattern. The coarse scale components are constructed from local solutions of the non-overlapping domain decomposition. This talk covers FROSch's features and recent updates, including the use of inexact local solvers on GPUs and CPUs for faster computation, extending the framework to multiscale and multiphysics problems, and employing machine learning techniques, such as graph neural networks, to improve coarse grid construction. Performance is evaluated on various problems, from simple models to real-world applications.},

DDMs have significantly influenced the development of numerical methods for differential equations for many years. Originating in the 19th century as a theoretical tool for exploring solutions to partial differential equations on complex domains, their divide-and-conquer strategy has proven well-suited for large-scale problems and parallel computing. Nowadays, DDMs form the foundation of many modern numerical solvers of both direct and iterative nature. Recently, DDMs have been integrated with machine learning techniques to enhance their performance and robustness. This underscores the continuing relevance and importance of DDMs in advancing computational methods.

Additionally, we employ a second type of overlapping domain decomposition in the form of additive and restricted additive Schwarz preconditioners for the least-squares problem, further enhancing solver efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this dual use of domain decomposition significantly reduces computational time while maintaining accuracy, particularly for multi-scale and time-dependent problems.},

    abstract = {Surrogate models—machine learning models designed to approximate complex and computationally expensive numerical simulations—are a key topic in scientific machine learning. These models are particularly relevant for parametrized problems, predicting solutions across a range of parameter configurations. While much of the existing work focuses on low-dimensional parameterizations, such as constant material properties, higher-dimensional parameterizations—spatially or temporally varying initial or boundary conditions, material distributions, or source terms—present significant methodological and computational challenges. Moreover, these cases are particularly important, as the potential benefits of the resulting surrogate models are even greater. This talk explores geometric aspects of machine learning-based surrogate modeling, focusing on convolutional neural networks and neural operators, such as deep operator networks (DeepONets). Both data-driven and physics-informed loss terms are being considered, and some novel directions are motivated for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The presentation focuses on strategies for learning complex spatial solution behaviors, addressing variations in the computational domain, and improving operator performance and scalability through spatio-temporal decomposition. Applications in multiscale and wave problems, as well as computational fluid dynamics, illustrate the potential of these methods.},

    abstract = {Monolithic GDSW (generalized Dryja–Smith–Wildund) preconditioners are scalable two-level Schwarz preconditioners for block systems. Compared with block domain decomposition preconditioners, monolithic domain decomposition preconditioners often yield faster convergence since they account for the coupling within the subdomain and coarse problems. In this talk, the focus is on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, in particular, saddle point problem resulting from the discretization of the (Navier-)Stokes equations. In this case, numerical results show that fast convergence and scalability of monolithic Schwarz preconditioners strongly depends on the choice of an appropriate pair of the velocity and pressure coarse spaces; in particular, there seem to be parallels to inf-sup stable discretizations. Whereas inf-sup stable Lagrangian coarse spaces, for instance, based on Taylor-Hood elements, yield scalable monolithic preconditioners, they are limited in their applicability to complicated geometries and unstructured domain decompositions. GDSW-type coarse spaces are well-suited for those cases, but, in general, an extension of the GDSW approach is required to construct appropriate pairs of velocity and pressure coarse spaces. Therefore, in this talk, a wider class of extension-based coarse spaces using various interface partitions of unity is explored. The numerical and parallel scalability for (Navier-)Stokes problems is then investigated using the parallel FROSch (Fast and Robust Overlapping Schwarz) preconditioner framework in Trilinos.},

    abstract = {This talk discusses several techniques for efficiently solving nonlinear problems using Schwarz methods. Newton-Krylov methods are widely used to solve nonlinear problems numerically. These methods linearize the system using Newton's method and solve the resulting linearized systems using a (preconditioned) Krylov method. When using domain decomposition preconditioners, the efficiency can be enhanced if information about the preconditioner from previous linearizations is reused. This includes structural information, such as the domain decomposition, certain index sets, and symbolic factorizations of the subdomain and coarse problems, but also certain components of the preconditioner, such as the coarse space. This typically leads to a speedup in the setup phase, resulting in a dominance of the time required for the solve phase; the solve phase can then be sped up by assign computations to GPUs. As an alternative to Newton-Krylov methods, nonlinear Schwarz preconditioning techniques can be employed to speed up both the nonlinear and linear convergence. In order to facilitate numerical scalability to large numbers of subdomains, a multi-level approach has to be employed; this leads to nonlinear multi-level Schwarz methods. The aforementioned approaches are being discussed and investigated in numerical experiments.},

    abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are highly relevant for a large range of applications, including but not restricted to the fields of aerospace, environmental, and biological engineering as well as weather predictions and medicine. Modeling Newtonian fluids involves the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, which, depending on the Reynolds number of the flow, may exhibit a highly nonlinear behavior. The system of nonlinear equations resulting from the discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations can be solved using nonlinear iteration methods, such as Newton’s method. However, fast quadratic convergence is typically only obtained in a local neighborhood of the solution, and for many configurations, the classical Newton iteration does not converge at all. In such cases, so-called globalization techniques may help to improve convergence. In this talk, pseudo-transient continuation is employed in order to improve nonlinear convergence. The classical algorithm is enhanced by a neural network model that is trained to predict a local pseudo-time step. Generalization of the novel approach is facilitated by predicting the local pseudo-time step separately on each element using only local information on a patch of adjacent elements as input. Numerical results for standard benchmark problems, including flow through a backward facing step geometry and Couette flow, show the performance of the machine learning-enhanced globalization approach; as the software for the simulations, the CFD module of COMSOL Multiphysics® is employed.},

A resolution of the fast (micro) scale over this period can easily require more than a billion time steps, each corresponding to the solution of a computationally expensive FSI problem. To tackle this problem, we combine a temporal homogenization approach with parallel time-stepping. First, a temporal homogenization approach is developed, which separates the problem in an FSI problem on the micro scale and a reaction-diffusion problem on the macro scale. The approach is analyzed in detail for a simplified flow problem and estimates for the homogenization error and the discretization errors on both time scales are given. Second, a parallel time-stepping approach based on the parareal algorithm is applied on the macro scale of the homogenized system. We investigate modifications in the coarse propagator of the parareal algorithm to further reduce the number of expensive micro problems to be solved and test the numerical algorithms in detailed numerical studies.},

In this talk, a machine learning-based model order reduction approach for predicting flow fields is presented. After an expensive offline phase, where a surrogate model based on a convolutional neural network (U-Net type architecture) is trained using simulation data, the predictions can be performed much faster than classical numerical simulations. Moreover, the predictions do not require the generation of a complex computational mesh. The surrogate model can be 100 or 10,000 times faster on a CPU or GPU, respectively, of a normal workstation. Numerical results investigating the accuracy and efficiency for varying types of geometries from different application areas are presented.

This talk will focus on presenting an algorithmic framework for the construction of coarse spaces for Schwarz preconditioners which is based on the generalized Dryja--Smith--Widlund (GDSW) coarse space. In particular, the coarse basis functions are extensions from the interface into the interior of a corresponding nonoverlapping domain decomposition by solving the homogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) with a given trace on the interface. This makes the coarse spaces very practical since they can be constructed in an algebraic way, that is, using only the fully assembled system matrix. This algorithmic framework is the basis for the highly-scalable FROSch (Fast and Robust Schwarz) solver package, which is part of the Trilinos software library. The FROSch package provides a parallel software framework to construct algebraic Schwarz preconditioners that are robust as well as numerically and parallel scalable for a wide range of problems. It provides a multi-level implementation to extend parallel scalability. Moreover, using extension-based coarse spaces, robust monolithic solvers for saddle-point problems, such as the (Navier--)Stokes equations and multi-physics problems in land ice simulations, can be constructed. Solving appropriate local eigenvalue problems on a partition of the interface to compute the traces of the coarse basis yields provably robust extension-based coarse spaces, even for highly heterogeneous model problems with large coefficient jumps. These adaptive coarse spaces are generally not algebraic since the eigenvalue problems require local Neumann matrices. However, by solving two local eigenvalue problems for each interface component instead, an algebraic and adaptive coarse space can be obtained. Finally, the framework can also be employed in nonlinear Schwarz preconditioning.},

    abstract = {CFD simulations are very costly to compute and have to be repeated if the geometry changes even slightly. Recently there have been a number of attempts to speed up this process using neural networks. Among these is the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as surrogate models for CFD simulations with varying geometries. Here, the model is trained on images of high-fidelity simulation results. However, the generation of training data is expensive and this approach usually requires a large data set. Thus, it is of interest to be able to train a CNN in the absence of abundant training data with the help of physical constraints. First results have already been achieved for the heat equation on a fixed geometry and flow problems in parameterizable geometries. In this talk, we present a physics-aware approach to train CNNs as surrogate models for CFD simulations in varying geometries. The employed CNN takes an imags of the geometry as input and returns images of the associated CFD simulation results, i.e., velocity and pressure, as output. Our CNN architecture is based on the structure of U-Net. Since the model is trained on pixel images, it can be applied to a variety of different geometries. We show results for two-dimensional flows around obstacles of varying size and placement and in non-rectangular geometries, esp. arteries and aneurysms.},

In particular, the focus is on the restricted additive Schwarz preconditioned exact Newton (RASPEN) method. It is based on additive Schwarz preconditioned Newton (ASPEN) method, which has been introduced together with the corresponding inexact method, ASPIN. Nonlinear domain decomposition methods can improve nonlinear as well as linear convergence. However, as in linear domain decomposition methods, scalability and robustness for difficult problems, such as highly heterogeneous problems, generally requires adding a coarse space. The coarse space can be integrated in an additive or multiplicative way using a Galerkin projection. This approach has proven to be very flexible, allowing for the use of different types of coarse spaces, such as classical Lagrangian or multiscale finite element method (MsFEM) type coarse spaces. Furthermore, to obtain robustness for heterogeneous problems, spectral coarse spaces, such as the adaptive generalized Dryja–Smith–Wildund (GDSW) coarse space can be employed. The main goal of this talk is to investigate the effectiveness of different coarse spaces, including GDSW, MsFEM, adaptive GDSW, and approximate component mode synthesis-based (OS-ACMS) adaptive coarse spaces for different nonlinear model problems and depending on the domain decomposition as well as heterogeneity of the problem.},

    abstract = {Simulations of fluid flow are generally very costly because high grid resolutions are not only required to obtain quantitatively accurate results, but too low grid resolutions may also lead to qualitatively incorrect results. In applications, however, one is often not interested in accurate approximations of the complete flow field but only in the qualitative behavior of the flow or in individual quantities (e.g., maximum velocity, pressure drop within a section of a pipe, or wall shear stresses at certain locations). In this talk, the use of convolutional autoencoder neural networks to construct efficient reduced order surrogate models for high fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations is discussed.

    abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are important in many application areas, such as civil and mechanical engineering, meteorology, geosciences, or medical science. However, accurate simulation results come at high computational costs, and they require high-quality meshes describing the computational domain. In this talk, a machine learning-based model order reduction approach for predicting flow fields is presented. After an expensive offline phase, where a surrogate model based on a convolutional neural network (U-Net type architecture) is trained using simulation data, the predictions can be performed much faster than classical numerical simulations. Moreover, the predictions do not require the generation of a complex computational mesh. The surrogate model can be 10^2 or 10^4 times faster on a CPU or GPU, respectively, of a normal workstation. Numerical results investigating the accuracy and efficiency for varying types of geometries from different application areas are presented. Moreover, different aspects to improve the performance such as the choice of more sophisticated loss functions are discussed.},

In order to make accurate predictions of realistic stress distributions using numerical fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations, the use of appropriate material models for the arterial walls is essential. In the literature, a wide range of material models is used for this purpose. In this talk, several existing material models for arterial walls are compared based on the curved tube FSI benchmark. In the benchmark configuration, the geometry corresponds to a bended idealized coronary artery with only one material layer. Furthermore, two phases are considered: first, the artery is brought to a physiological pressure of 80 mmHg, and second, the inflow profile of one heartbeat is imposed. As material models, linear elasticity, isotropic hyperelasticity, i.e., a Neo-Hookean material model, as well as the nonlinear anisotropic hyperelastic material models are taken into account. Numerical results for both linear elasticity and Neo-Hookean material models differ significantly from the results obtained with nonlinear anisotropic hyperelastic material models, which have been fitted to experimental data of real arteries. Moreover, the performance of the parallel FSI simulations using different material models is investigated.},

    abstract = {Schwarz methods are an algorithmic framework for a large class of domain decomposition methods. The software FROSch (Fast and Robust Overlapping Schwarz), which is part of the Trilinos package ShyLU, provides a highly scalable implementation of the Schwarz framework, and the resulting solvers are based on the construction and combination of the relevant Schwarz operators. FROSch currently focusses on Schwarz operators that are algebraic in the sense that they can be constructed from a fully assembled, parallel distributed matrix. This is facilitated by the use of extension-based coarse spaces, such as generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund (GDSW) type coarse spaces. This talk will cover several Schwarz preconditioning techniques which are currently being developed based on the FROSch package: reduced dimension coarse spaces, multilevel GDSW preconditioners, and monolithic preconditioners for block systems. These approaches are introduced and applied to different problems ranging from a simple Poisson equation to a coupled multiphysics simulations of land ice in Greenland and Antarctica. Furthermore, a brief overview of related Schwarz preconditioning techniques which are currently being developed but not implemented in FROSch yet will be given. This includes nonlinear two-level Schwarz preconditioning techniques based on Galerkin projections, adaptive coarse spaces for highly heterogeneous problems, as well as novel hybrid preconditioning algorithms combining adaptive coarse spaces and machine learning techniques.},

    abstract = {Simulations of fluid flow are generally very costly because too low grid resolutions may even lead to qualitatively incorrect solutions. In applications, however, one is often not interested in accurate approximations of the complete flow field but only in the qualitative behavior of the flow or in individual quantities (e.g., maximum velocity, pressure drop within a section of a pipe, or wall shear stresses at certain locations). In this talk, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict fluid flow fields is investigated. Therefore, U-Net [Ronneberger et al., 2015] type convolutional neural networks, which are successfully used for image recognition and segmentation tasks, are applied in this context. As a model problem, the flow around obstacles with varying shape and size within a channel is considered. Obstacles of certain type are used as training data, and the generalization of the models to other obstacle geometries and sizes is analyzed. Even though, the training of a neural network is expensive, its evaluation is quite cheap compared to fully resolved Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. This results in a multitude of application possibilities for neural networks in this context, especially in time critical settings.},
