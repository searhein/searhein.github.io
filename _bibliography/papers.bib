    abstract = {A temporal homogenization approach for the numerical simulation of atherosclerotic plaque growth is extended to fully coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations. The numerical results indicate that the two-scale approach yields significantly different results compared to a simple heuristic averaging, where only stationary long-scale FSI problems are solved, confirming the importance of incorporating stress variations on small time-scales. In the homogenization approach, a periodic fine-scale problem, which is periodic with respect to the heart beat, has to be solved for each long-scale time step. Even if no exact initial conditions are available, periodicity can be achieved within only 2--3 heart beats by simple time-stepping.},

    abstract = {The course of an epidemic can be often successfully described mathematically using compartment models. These models result in a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations. Two well-known examples are the SIR and the SEIR models. The transition rates between the diﬀerent compartments are deﬁned by certain parameters which are speciﬁc for the respective virus. Often, these parameters can be taken from the literature or can be determined from statistics. However, the contact rate or the related eﬀective reproduction number are in general not constant and thus cannot easily be determined. Here, a new machine learning approach based on physics-informed neural networks is presented that can learn the contact rate from given data for the dynamical systems given by the SIR and SEIR models. The new method generalizes an already known approach for the identiﬁcation of constant parameters to the variable or time-dependent case. After introducing the new method, it is tested for synthetic data generated by the numerical solution of SIR and SEIR models. Here, the case of exact and perturbed data is considered. In all cases, the contact rate can be learned very satisfactorily. Finally, the SEIR model in combination with physics-informed neural networks is used to learn the contact rate for COVID-19 data given by the course of the epidemic in Germany. The simulation of the number of infected individuals over the course of the epidemic, using the learned contact rate, is very promising.},

    abstract = {The hybrid ML-FETI-DP algorithm combines the advantages of adaptive coarse spaces in domain decomposition methods and certain supervised machine learning techniques. Adaptive coarse spaces ensure robustness of highly scalable domain decomposition solvers, even for highly heterogeneous coefficient distributions with arbitrary coefficient jumps. However, their construction requires the setup and solution of local generalized eigenvalue problems, which is typically computationally expensive. The idea of ML-FETI-DP is to interpret the coefficient distribution as image data and predict whether an eigenvalue problem has to be solved or can be neglected while still maintaining robustness of the adaptive FETI-DP method. For this purpose, neural networks are used as image classifiers. In the present work, the ML-FETI-DP algorithm is extended to three dimensions, which requires both a complex data preprocessing procedure to construct consistent input data for the neural network as well as a representative training and validation data set to ensure generalization properties of the machine learning model. Numerical experiments for stationary diffusion and linear elasticity problems with realistic coefficient distributions show that a large number of eigenvalue problems can be saved; in the best case of the numerical results presented here, 97% of the eigenvalue problems can be avoided to be set up and solved.},

However, accurate simulations are generally very costly because they require high grid resolutions. In this paper, an alternative approach for computing flow predictions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is described; in particular, a classical CNN as well as the U-Net architecture are used. First, the networks are trained in an expensive offline phase using flow fields computed by CFD simulations. Afterwards, the evaluation of the trained neural networks is very cheap. Here, the focus is on the dependence of the stationary flow in a channel on variations of the shape and the location of an obstacle. CNNs perform very well on validation data, where the averaged error for the best networks is below 3%. In addition to that, they also generalize very well to new data, with an averaged error below 10%.},

In this paper, fully algebraic variants, which are constructed solely from the uniquely distributed system matrix, are compared to the classical variants which make use of this additional information; the fully algebraic variants use an approximation of the interface and an incomplete algebraic null space. Nevertheless, the parallel performance of the fully algebraic variants is competitive compared to the classical variants for a stationary homogeneous model problem and a dynamic heterogenous model problem with coefficient jumps in the shear modulus; the largest parallel computations were performed on 4,096 MPI (Message Passing Interface) ranks.

To retain the robustness for such highly heterogeneous problems, the coarse space can be enriched by additional coarse basis functions. These can be obtained by solving local generalized eigenvalue problems on subdomain edges. In order to reduce the number of eigenvalue problems and thus the computational cost, we use a neural network to predict the geometric location of critical edges, i.e., edges where the eigenvalue problem is indispensable. As input data for the neural network, we use function evaluations of the coefficient function within the two subdomains adjacent to an edge. In the present article, we examine the effect of computing the input data only in a neighborhood of the edge, i.e., on slabs next to the edge. We show numerical results for both the training data as well as for a concrete test problem in form of a microsection subsection for linear elasticity problems. We observe that computing the sampling points only in one half or one quarter of each subdomain still provides robust algorithms.},

Here, our focus is on a very speciﬁc area within scientiﬁc machine learning given by the combination of domain decomposition methods with machine learning techniques. The aim of the present work is to make an attempt of providing a review of existing and also new approaches within this field as well as to present some known results in a uniﬁed framework; no claim of completeness is made. As a concrete example of machine learning enhanced domain decomposition methods, an approach is presented which uses neural networks to reduce the computational eﬀort in adaptive domain decomposition methods while retaining their robustness. More precisely, deep neural networks are used to predict the geometric location of constraints which are needed to deﬁne a robust coarse space. Additionally, two recently published deep domain decomposition approaches are presented in a uniﬁed framework. Both approaches use physics-constrained neural networks to replace the discretization and solution of the subdomain problems of a given decomposition of the computational domain. Finally, a brief overview is given of several further approaches which combine machine learning with ideas from domain decomposition methods to either increase the performance of already existing algorithms or to create completely new methods.},

    abstract = {The convergence rate of domain decomposition methods is generally determined by the eigenvalues of the preconditioned system. For second-order elliptic partial differential equations, coefficient discontinuities with a large contrast can lead to a deterioration of the convergence rate. Only by implementing an appropriate coarse space or second level, a robust domain decomposition method can be obtained. In this article, a new frugal coarse space for FETI-DP (Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting - Dual Primal) and BDDC (Balancing Domain Decomposition by Constraints) methods is presented, which has a lower set-up cost than competing adaptive coarse spaces. In particular, in contrast to adaptive coarse spaces, it does not require the solution of any local generalized eigenvalue problems. The approach considered here aims at a low-dimensional approximation of the adaptive coarse space by using appropriate weighted averages and is robust for a broad range of coefficient distributions for diffusion and elasticity problems. In this article, the robustness is heuristically justified as well as numerically shown for several coefficient distributions. The new coarse space is compared to adaptive coarse spaces, and parallel scalability up to 262,144 parallel cores for a parallel BDDC implementation with the new coarse space is shown. The superiority of the new coarse space over classic coarse spaces with respect to parallel weak scalability and time to solution is confirmed by numerical experiments.},

For several model problems, these approaches outperform classical inexact Newton methods, where a corresponding linear DD method is used to solve the linearized problems, in terms of linear and nonlinear iteration counts and time to solution. As in the linear case, in nonlinear DD methods, an appropriate coarse space is often necessary for robustness and numerical scalability. In this paper, a new multiplicative implementation of a coarse space for ASPIN as well as the related RASPEN (Restricted Additive Schwarz Preconditioned Exact Newton) method is suggested. Additionally, several coarse spaces, which are also applicable for unstructured meshes and domain decompositions, are suggested. Robustness and numerical scalability is shown for different homogeneous and heterogeneous p-Laplace problems in two spatial dimensions.},

These nonlinear DD approaches are often able to effectively tackle unevenly distributed nonlinearities and outperform Newton's method with respect to convergence speed as well as global convergence behavior. Furthermore, they often improve parallel scalability due to a superior ratio of local to global work. Nonetheless, as for linear DD methods, it is often necessary to incorporate an appropriate coarse space in a second level to obtain numerical scalability for increasing numbers of subdomains. In addition, an appropriate coarse space can also improve the nonlinear convergence of nonlinear DD methods. In this paper, we introduce four variants for integrating coarse spaces in nonlinear Schwarz methods in an additive or multiplicative way using Galerkin projections. These new variants can be interpreted as natural nonlinear equivalents to well-known linear additive and hybrid two-level Schwarz preconditioners. Furthermore, they facilitate the use of various coarse spaces, e.g., coarse spaces based on energy-minimizing extensions, which can easily be used for irregular DDs, such as, e.g., those obtained by graph partitioners. In particular, multiscale finite element method (MsFEM)-type coarse spaces are considered, and it is shown that they outperform classical approaches for certain heterogeneous nonlinear problems. The new approaches are then compared with classical Newton--Krylov-DD and nonlinear one-level Schwarz approaches for different homogeneous and heterogeneous model problems based on the $p$-Laplace operator.},

However, the computational costs for the setup and the application of monolithic preconditioners are typically higher. In this article, several techniques are applied to monolithic two-level generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund (GDSW) preconditioners to further improve the convergence speed and the computing time. In particular, reduced dimension GDSW coarse spaces, restricted and scaled versions of the first level, hybrid, and parallel coupling of the levels, and recycling strategies are investigated. Using a combination of all these improvements, for a small time-dependent Navier-Stokes problem on 240 message passing interface (MPI) ranks, a reduction of 86\% of the time-to-solution can be obtained. Even without applying recycling strategies, the time-to-solution can be reduced by more than 50\% for a larger steady Stokes problem on 4608 MPI ranks. For the largest problems with 11â979 MPI ranks, the scalability deteriorates drastically for the monolithic GDSW coarse space. On the other hand, using the reduced dimension coarse spaces, good scalability up to 11â979 MPI ranks, which corresponds to the largest problem configuration fitting on the employed supercomputer, could be achieved.},

    abstract = {Domain decomposition methods are robust and parallel scalable, preconditioned iterative algorithms for the solution of the large linear systems arising in the discretization of elliptic partial differential equations by finite elements. The convergence rate of these methods is generally determined by the eigenvalues of the preconditioned system. For second-order elliptic partial differential equations, coefficient discontinuities with a large contrast can lead to a deterioration of the convergence rate. A remedy can be obtained by enhancing the coarse space with elements, which are often called constraints, that are computed by solving small eigenvalue problems on portions of the interface of the domain decomposition, i.e., edges in two dimensions or faces and edges in three dimensions. In the present work, without restriction of generality, the focus is on two dimensions. In general, it is difficult to predict where these constraints have to be added, and therefore the corresponding local eigenvalue problems have to be computed, i.e., on which edges. Here, a machine learning based strategy using neural networks is suggested to predict the geometric location of these edges in a preprocessing step. This reduces the number of eigenvalue problems that have to be solved before the iteration. Numerical experiments for model problems and realistic microsections using regular decompositions as well as decompositions from graph partitioners are provided, showing very promising results.},

While the convergence of standard coarse spaces may depend strongly on the contrast of the coefficient function, the condition number bound of the new method is independent of the coefficient function. Indeed, the condition number only depends on a user-prescribed tolerance. The coarse space is based on discrete harmonic extensions of vertex, edge, and face interface functions, which are computed from the solutions of corresponding local generalized edge and face eigenvalue problems. The local eigenvalue problems are of the size of the edges and faces of the decomposition, and the eigenvalue problems can be constructed solely from the local subdomain stiffness matrices and the fully assembled global stiffness matrix. The new AGDSW (adaptive generalized Dryja--Smith--Widlund) coarse space always contains the classical GDSW coarse space by construction of the generalized eigenvalue problems. Numerical results supporting the theory are presented for several model problems in three dimensions using structured as well as unstructured meshes and unstructured decompositions.},

In order to obtain numerically scalable algorithms, coarse spaces obtained from the generalized Dryja--Smith--Widlund (GDSW) approach are used. Numerical results of our parallel implementation are presented for various incompressible fluid flow problems. In particular, cases are considered where the problem cannot or should not be reduced using local static condensation, e.g., Stokes or Navier--Stokes problems with continuous pressure spaces. In the new monolithic preconditioners, the local overlapping problems and the coarse problem are saddle point problems with the same structure as the original problem. Our parallel implementation of these preconditioners is based on the fast and robust overlapping Schwarz (FROSch) library, which is part of the Trilinos package ShyLU. The implementation is essentially algebraic in the sense that, for the class of problems presented here, the preconditioners can be constructed from the fully assembled stiffness matrix and information about the block structure of the problem. Further information about the geometry or the null space of the underlying problem can improve the performance compared to the default settings. Parallel scalability results for several thousand cores for Stokes and Navier--Stokes model problems are reported. Each of the local problems is solved using a direct solver in serial mode, whereas the coarse problem is solved using a direct solver in serial or message passing interface (MPI)-parallel mode or using an MPI-parallel iterative Krylov solver.},

    abstract = {Accurate simulations of transmural wall stresses in artherosclerotic coronary arteries may help to predict plaque rupture. Therefore, a robust and efficient numerical framework for Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) of the blood flow and the arterial wall has to be set up, and suitable material laws for the modeling of the fluid and the structural response have to be incorporated. In this thesis, monolithic coupling algorithms and corresponding monolithic preconditioners are used to simulate FSI using highly nonlinear anisotropic polyconvex hyperelastic and anisotropic viscoelastic material models for the arterial wall. An MPI-parallel FSI software from the LifeV library is coupled to the software FEAP in order to enable access to the structural material models implemented in FEAP. To define a benchmark test for highly nonlinear material models in FSI, a simple geometry corresponding to a section of an idealized coronary artery, suitable boundary conditions, and material parameters adapted to experimental data are used. In particular, the geometry is chosen to be nonsymmetric to make effects due to the anisotropy of the structure visible. An initialization phase and several heartbeats are simulated, and systematical studies with meshes of increasing refinement and different space discretizations are carried out. The results indicate that, for the highly nonlinear material models, piecewise quadratic or F-bar element discretizations lead to significantly better results than piecewise linear shape functions. The results using piecewise linear shape functions are less accurate with respect to the displacements and, in particular, to the approximation of the stresses. To improve the performance of the FSI simulations, a more robust preconditioner for the highly nonlinear structural material models has to be used. Therefore, a parallel implementation of the GDSW (Generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund) preconditioner, which is a geometric two-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioner with energy-minimizing coarse space, is presented. The implementation, which is based on the software library Trilinos, is held flexible to make further extensions of the preconditioner possible. Even though the dimension of its coarse space is comparably large, parallel scalability for two and three dimensional scalar elliptic and linear elastic problems for thousands of cores is demonstrated. Also for unstructured domain decompositions and for a hybrid version of the preconditioner, convincing scalability is presented. When used as a preconditioner for the structure block in FSI simulations, the GDSW preconditioner shows excellent performance as well: scalability for up to 512 cores and a significant reduction of the simulation time and of the number of iterations with respect to the previously used preconditioner, IFPACK, are observed. IFPACK is an algebraic one-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioner. Finally, highly heterogeneous (multiscale) problems are investigated. Since the GDSW coarse space is not robust for general problems of this type, spaces based on Approximate Component Mode Synthesis (ACMS) are considered. On the basis of the ACMS space, coarse spaces for overlapping Schwarz methods are constructed, and a parallel implementation of a special finite element method is presented. For the coarse spaces, preliminary results indicating numerical scalability and robustness are discussed. For the parallel implementation of the special finite element method, very good parallel weak scalability is observed with respect to the construction of the basis functions and to the solution of the resulting linear system using the FETI-DP (Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting - Dual Primal) method.},

One of the main contributions of this paper is the application of a highly nonlinear, polyconvex anisotropic structural model for the solid in the context of fluid-structure interaction, together with a suitable discretization. Additionally, the influence of viscoelasticity is investigated. The fluid-structure interaction problem is solved using a monolithic approach; that is, the nonlinear system is solved (after time and space discretizations) as a whole without splitting among its components. The linearized block systems are solved iteratively using parallel domain decomposition preconditioners. A simple but nonsymmetric curved geometry is proposed that is demonstrated to be suitable as a benchmark testbed for fluid-structure interaction simulations in biomechanics where nonlinear structural models are used. Based on the curved benchmark geometry, the influence of different material models, spatial discretizations, and meshes of varying refinement is investigated. It turns out that often-used standard displacement elements with linear shape functions are not sufficient to provide good approximations of the arterial wall stresses, whereas for standard displacement elements or F-bar formulations with quadratic shape functions, suitable results are obtained. For the time discretization, a second-order backward differentiation formula scheme is used. It is shown that the curved geometry enables the analysis of non-rotationally symmetric distributions of the mechanical fields. For instance, the maximal shear stresses in the fluidâstructure interface are found to be higher in the inner curve that corresponds to clinical observations indicating a high plaque nucleation probability at such locations.},

It is possible to describe the coupled problem at the interface between the fluid and the structure, yielding a nonlinear Steklov-Poincar\'e problem. The linear system can be linearized by Newton iterations on the interface and the resulting linear problem can be solved by the preconditioned GMRES method. In this work we investigate the behavior of preconditioners of Neumann-Neumann and Dirichlet-Neumann type. We find that, in the context of hemodynamics, the Dirichlet-Neumann, i.e., using Dirichlet boundary conditions on the fluid side and Neumann on the structure side, outperforms the Neumann-Neumann method, except when a weighting is used such that it basically reduces to the Dirichlet-Neumann method.},

    note = {Accepted for publication in SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing. January 2022},
    abbr = {SISC},
    abstract = {Numerical simulations of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets involve the solution of large-scale highly nonlinear systems of equations on complex shallow geometries. This work is concerned with the construction of Schwarz preconditioners for the solution of the associated tangent problems, which are challenging for solvers mainly because of the strong anisotropy of the meshes and wildly changing boundary conditions that can lead to poorly constrained problems on large portions of the domain. Here, two-level GDSW (Generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund) type Schwarz preconditioners are applied to diﬀerent land ice problems, i.e., a velocity problem, a temperature problem, as well as the coupling of the former two problems. We employ the MPI-parallel implementation of multi-level Schwarz preconditioners provided by the package FROSch (Fast and Robust Schwarz) from the Trilinos library. The strength of the proposed preconditioner is that it yields out-of-the-box scalable and robust preconditioners for the single physics problems. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time two-level Schwarz preconditioners are applied to the ice sheet problem and a scalable preconditioner has been used for the coupled problem. The preconditioner for the coupled problem diﬀers from previous monolithic GDSW preconditioners in the sense that decoupled extension operators are used to compute the values in the interior of the subdomains. Several approaches for improving the performance, such as reuse strategies and shared memory OpenMP parallelization, are explored as well. In our numerical study we target both uniform meshes of varying resolution for the Antarctic ice sheet as well as non uniform meshes for the Greenland ice sheet are considered. We present several weak and strong scaling studies conﬁrming the robustness of the approach and the parallel scalability of the FROSch implementation. Among the highlights of the numerical results are a weak scaling study for up to 32 K processor cores (8 K MPI-ranks and 4 OpenMP threads) and 566 M degrees of freedom for the velocity problem as well as a strong scaling study for up to 4 K processor cores (and MPI-ranks) and 68 M degrees of freedom for the coupled problem.},

In particular, the neural networks are trained in order to predict images of the flow field in a channel with varying obstacle based on an image of the geometry of the channel. A classical CNN with bottleneck structure and a U-Net are compared while varying the input format, the number of decoder paths, as well as the loss function used to train the networks. This approach yields very low prediction errors, in particular, when using the U-Net architecture. Furthermore, the models are also able to generalize to unseen geometries of the same type. A transfer learning approach enables the model to be trained to a new type of geometries with very low training cost. Finally, based on this transfer learning approach, a sequential learning strategy is introduced, which significantly reduces the amount of necessary training data.},

    note = {Accepted for publication in SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing. October 2021},
    abbr = {SISC},
    abstract = {A new reduced dimension adaptive GDSW (Generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund) overlapping Schwarz method for linear second-order elliptic problems in three dimensions is introduced. It is robust with respect to large contrasts of the coefficients of the partial differential equations. The condition number bound of the new method is shown to be independent of the coefficient contrast and only dependent on a user-prescribed tolerance. The interface of the nonoverlapping domain decomposition is partitioned into nonoverlapping patches. The new coarse space is obtained by selecting a few eigenvectors of certain local eigenproblems which are defined on these patches. These eigenmodes are energy-minimally extended to the interior of the nonoverlapping subdomains and added to the coarse space. By using a new interface decomposition the reduced dimension adaptive GDSW overlapping Schwarz method usually has a smaller coarse space than existing GDSW and adaptive GDSW domain decomposition methods. A robust condition number estimate is proven for the new reduced dimension adaptive GDSW method which is also valid for existing adaptive GDSW methods. Numerical results for the equations of isotropic linear elasticity in three dimensions confirming the theoretical findings are presented.},

    note = {Accepted for publication in the proceedings of the DD26 conference. August 2021.},
    abbr = {Springer LNCSE},
    abstract = {Overlapping GDSW domain decomposition methods are considered for diffusion problems in two dimensions discretized by finite elements. For a diffusion coefficient with high contrast, the condition number is usually dependent on it. A remedy is given by adaptive domain decomposition methods, where the coarse space is enhanced by additional coarse basis functions. These are chosen problem-dependently by solving small local eigenvalue problems. Here, the eigenvalue problems (EVPs) are associated with the edges of the domain decomposition interface; edges, where these EVPs have to be solved are denoted as critical edges. For many applications, not all edges are critical and the solution of the EVPs is not necessary. In an earlier work, a strategy to predict the location of critical edges, based on deep learning, has been proposed for adaptive FETI-DP, a class of nonoverlapping methods. In the present work, this strategy is successfully applied to  adaptive GDSW; differences in the classification process for this overlapping method are described. Choosing the classification threshold has been a challenge in all these approaches. Here, for the first time, a heuristic based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the precision-recall graph is discussed. Results for a challenging realistic coefficient function are presented.},

    title = {Towards parallel time-stepping for the numerical simulation of atherosclerotic plaque growth},
    note = {Submitted March 2022},
    abstract = {The numerical simulation of atherosclerotic plaque growth is computationally prohibitive, since it involves a complex cardiovascular fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem with a characteristic time scale of milliseconds to seconds, as well as a plaque growth process governed by reaction-diffusion equations, which takes place over several months. In this work we combine a temporal homogenization approach, which separates the problem in computationally expensive FSI problems on a micro scale and a reaction-diffusion problem on the macro scale, with parallel time-stepping algorithms. It has been found in the literature that parallel time-stepping algorithms do not perform well when applied directly to the FSI problem. To circumvent this problem, a parareal algorithm is applied on the macro scale reaction-diffusion problem instead of the micro scale FSI problem. We investigate modifications in the coarse propagator of the parareal algorithm, in order to further reduce the number of costly micro problems to be solved. The approaches are tested in detailed numerical investigations based on serial simulations.},

    note = {Submitted March 2022},
    abstract = {Monolithic fluid-structure interaction (FSI) of blood ﬂow with arterial walls is considered, making use of sophisticated nonlinear wall models. These incorporate the eﬀects of almost incompressibility as well as of the anisotropy caused by embedded collagen ﬁbers. In the literature, relatively simple structural models such as Neo-Hooke are often considered for FSI with arterial walls. Such models lack, both, anisotropy and incompressibility. In this paper, numerical simulations of idealized heart beats in a curved benchmark geometry, using simple and sophisticated arterial wall models, are compared: we consider three diﬀerent almost incompressible, anisotropic arterial wall models as a reference and, for comparison, a simple, isotropic Neo-Hooke model using four different parameter sets. The simulations show significant quantitative and qualitative diﬀerences in the stresses and displacements as well as the lumen cross sections. For the Neo-Hooke models, a significantly larger amplitude in the in- and outﬂow areas during the heart beat is observed, presumably due to the lack of ﬁber stiﬀening. For completeness, we also consider a linear elastic wall using 16 different parameter sets. However, using our benchmark setup, we were not successful in achieving good agreement with our nonlinear reference calculation.},

    abstract = {In this article, different nonlinear domain decomposition methods are applied to nonlinear problems with highly-heterogeneous coeﬃcient functions with jumps. In order to obtain a robust solver with respect to nonlinear as well as linear convergence, adaptive coarse spaces are employed. First, as an example for a nonlinearly left-preconditioned domain decomposition method, the two-level restricted nonlinear Schwarz method H1-RASPEN (Hybrid Restricted Additive Schwarz Preconditioned Exact Newton) is combined with an adaptive generalized Dryja–Smith–Widlund (GDSW) coarse space. Second, as an example for a nonlinearly right-preconditioned domain decomposition method, a nonlinear FETI-DP (Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting - Dual Primal) method is equipped with an edge-based adaptive coarse space. Both approaches are compared with the respective nonlinear domain decomposition methods with classical coarse spaces as well as with the respective Newton-Krylov methods with adaptive coarse spaces. For some two-dimensional pLaplace model problems with diﬀerent spatial coeﬃcient distributions, it can be observed that the best linear and nonlinear convergence can only be obtained when combining the nonlinear domain decomposition methods with adaptive coarse spaces.},

    title = {Parallel Scalability of Three-Level FROSch Preconditioners to 220 000 Cores using the Theta Supercomputer},
    note = {Submitted Juli 2021},
    abstract = {The parallel performance of the three-level Fast and Robust Overlapping Schwarz (FROSch) preconditioners is investigated for linear elasticity. The FROSch framework is part of the Trilinos software library and contains a parallel implementation of diﬀerent preconditioners with energy minimizing coarse spaces of GDSW (Generalized Dryja–Smith–Widlund) type. The three-level extension is constructed by a recursive application of the FROSch preconditioner to the coarse problem. In this paper, the additional steps in the implementation in order to apply the FROSch preconditioner recursively are described in detail. Furthermore, it is shown that no explicit geometric information is needed in the recursive application of the preconditioner. In particular, the rigid body modes, including the rotations, can be interpolated on the coarse level without additional geometric information. Parallel results for a three-dimensional linear elasticity problem obtained on the Theta supercomputer (ALCF, Argonne, USA) using up to 220 000 cores are discussed and compared to results obtained on the SuperMUC-NG supercomputer (LRZ, Garching, Germany). Notably, it can be observed that a hierarchical communication operation in FROSch related to the coarse operator starts to dominate the computing time on Theta for 100 000 MPI ranks or more. The same operation, however, scales well and stays within the order of a second in all experiments performed on SuperMUC-NG. Using hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization, better performance is then achieved on Theta.},
