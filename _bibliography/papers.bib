    abstract = {In this work, we propose and analyze an extension of the approximate component mode synthesis (ACMS) method to the two-dimensional heterogeneous Helmholtz equation. The ACMS method has originally been introduced by Hetmaniuk and Lehoucq as a multiscale method to solve elliptic partial differential equations. The ACMS method uses a domain decomposition to separate the numerical approximation by splitting the variational problem into two independent parts: local Helmholtz problems and a global interface problem. While the former are naturally local and decoupled such that they can be easily solved in parallel, the latter requires the construction of suitable local basis functions relying on local eigenmodes and suitable extensions. We carry out a full error analysis of this approach focusing on the case where the domain decomposition is kept fixed, but the number of eigenfunctions is increased. The theoretical results in this work are supported by numerical experiments verifying algebraic convergence for the method. In certain, practically relevant cases, even super-algebraic convergence for the local Helmholtz problems can be achieved without oversampling.},

Finite basis physics-informed neural networks (FBPINNs) improve the performance of PINNs in this regime by combining them with an overlapping domain decomposition approach. In this work, FBPINNs are extended by adding multiple levels of domain decompositions to their solution ansatz, inspired by classical multilevel Schwarz domain decomposition methods (DDMs). Analogous to typical tests for classical DDMs, we assess how the accuracy of PINNs, FBPINNs and multilevel FBPINNs scale with respect to computational effort and solution complexity by carrying out strong and weak scaling tests. Our numerical results show that the proposed multilevel FBPINNs consistently and significantly outperform PINNs across a range of problems with high frequency and multi-scale solutions. Furthermore, as expected in classical DDMs, we show that multilevel FBPINNs improve the accuracy of FBPINNs when using large numbers of subdomains by aiding global communication between subdomains.},

    abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) [4, 10] are an approach for solving boundary value problems based on differential equations (PDEs). The key idea of PINNs is to use a neural network to approximate the solution to the PDE and to incorporate the residual of the PDE as well as boundary conditions into its loss function when training it. This provides a simple and mesh-free approach for solving problems relating to PDEs. However, a key limitation of PINNs is their lack of accuracy and efficiency when solving problems with larger domains and more complex, multi-scale solutions. In a more recent approach, finite basis physics-informed neural networks (FBPINNs) [8] use ideas from domain decomposition to accelerate the learning process of PINNs and improve their accuracy. In this work, we show how Schwarz-like additive, multiplicative, and hybrid iteration methods for training FBPINNs can be developed. We present numerical experiments on the influence of these different training strategies on convergence and accuracy. Furthermore, we propose and evaluate a preliminary implementation of coarse space correction for FBPINNs.},

These preconditioners include highly scalable parallel GDSW (generalized Dryja–Smith–Widlund) and RGDSW (reduced GDSW) preconditioners. Simulation results show the expected increase in the lumen diameter of an idealized artery due to the drug-induced reduction of smooth muscle contraction, as well as a decrease in the rate of arterial contraction in the presence of calcium channel blockers.

    abstract = {Accurate short-term prediction of phase-resolved water wave conditions is crucial for decision-making in ocean engineering. However, the initialization of remote-sensing-based wave prediction models first requires a reconstruction of wave surfaces from sparse measurements like radar. Existing reconstruction methods either rely on computationally intensive optimization procedures or simplistic modeling assumptions that compromise real-time capability or accuracy of the entire prediction process. We therefore address these issues by proposing a novel approach for phase-resolved wave surface reconstruction using neural networks based on the U-Net and Fourier neural operator (FNO) architectures. Our approach utilizes synthetic yet highly realistic training data on uniform one-dimensional grids, that is generated by the high-order spectral method for wave simulation and a geometric radar modeling approach. The investigation reveals that both models deliver accurate wave reconstruction results and show good generalization for different sea states when trained with spatio-temporal radar data containing multiple historic radar snapshots in each input. Notably, the FNO-based network performs better in handling the data structure imposed by wave physics due to its global approach to learn the mapping between input and desired output in Fourier space.},

    abstract = {The generalized Dryja–Smith–Widlund (GDSW) preconditioner is a two-level overlapping Schwarz domain decomposition (DD) preconditioner that couples a classical one-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioner with an energy-minimizing coarse space. When used to accelerate the convergence rate of Krylov subspace iterative methods, the GDSW preconditioner provides robustness and scalability for the solution of sparse linear systems arising from the discretization of a wide range of partial different equations. In this paper, we present FROSch (Fast and Robust Schwarz), a domain decomposition solver package which implements GDSW-type preconditioners for both CPU and GPU clusters. To improve the solver performance on GPUs, we use a novel decomposition to run multiple MPI processes on each GPU, reducing both solver’s computational and storage costs and potentially improving the convergence rate. This allowed us to obtain competitive or faster performance using GPUs compared to using CPUs alone. We demonstrate the performance of FROSch on the Summit supercomputer with NVIDIA V100 GPUs, where we used NVIDIA Multi-Process Service (MPS) to implement our decomposition strategy.The solver has a wide variety of algorithmic and implementation choices, which poses both opportunities and challenges for its GPU implementation. We conduct a thorough experimental study with different solver options including the exact or inexact solution of the local overlapping subdomain problems on a GPU. We also discuss the effect of using the iterative variant of the incomplete LU factorization and sparse-triangular solve as the approximate local solver, and using lower precision for computing the whole FROSch preconditioner. Overall, the solve time was reduced by factors of about 2× using GPUs, while the GPU acceleration of the numerical setup time depend on the solver options and the local matrix sizes.},

In this work we combine a temporal homogenization approach, which separates the problem in computationally expensive FSI problems on a micro scale and a reaction-diffusion problem on the macro scale, with parallel time-stepping algorithms. It has been found in the literature that parallel time-stepping algorithms do not perform well when applied directly to the FSI problem. To circumvent this problem, a parareal algorithm is applied on the macro-scale reaction-diffusion problem instead of the micro-scale FSI problem. We investigate modifications in the coarse propagator of the parareal algorithm, in order to further reduce the number of costly micro problems to be solved. The approaches are tested in detailed numerical investigations based on serial simulations.},

The simulations show significant quantitative and qualitative diﬀerences in the stresses and displacements as well as the lumen cross sections.

    abstract = {Overlapping GDSW domain decomposition methods are considered for diffusion problems in two dimensions discretized by finite elements. For a diffusion coefficient with high contrast, the condition number is usually dependent on it. A remedy is given by adaptive domain decomposition methods, where the coarse space is enhanced by additional coarse basis functions. These are chosen problem-dependently by solving small local eigenvalue problems. Here, the eigenvalue problems (EVPs) are associated with the edges of the domain decomposition interface; edges, where these EVPs have to be solved are denoted as critical edges. For many applications, not all edges are critical and the solution of the EVPs is not necessary. In an earlier work, a strategy to predict the location of critical edges, based on deep learning, has been proposed for adaptive FETI-DP, a class of nonoverlapping methods. In the present work, this strategy is successfully applied to  adaptive GDSW; differences in the classification process for this overlapping method are described. Choosing the classification threshold has been a challenge in all these approaches. Here, for the first time, a heuristic based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the precision-recall graph is discussed. Results for a challenging realistic coefficient function are presented.},

    abstract = {The parallel performance of the three-level fast and robust overlapping Schwarz (FROSch) preconditioners is investigated for linear elasticity. The FROSch framework is part of the Trilinos software library and contains a parallel implementation of different preconditioners with energy minimizing coarse spaces of generalized Dryja--Smith--Widlund type. The three-level extension is constructed by a recursive application of the FROSch preconditioner to the coarse problem. In this paper, the additional steps in the implementation in order to apply the FROSch preconditioner recursively are described in detail. Furthermore, it is shown that no explicit geometric information is needed in the recursive application of the preconditioner. In particular, the rigid body modes, including the rotations, can be interpolated on the coarse level without additional geometric information. Parallel results for a three-dimensional linear elasticity problem obtained on the Theta supercomputer (Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, Argonne, IL) using up to 220 000 cores are discussed and compared to results obtained on the SuperMUC-NG supercomputer (Leibniz Supercomputing Centre, Garching, Germany). Notably, it can be observed that a hierarchical communication operation in FROSch related to the coarse operator starts to dominate the computing time on Theta, which has a dragonfly interconnect, for 100 000 message passing interface (MPI) ranks or more. The same operation, however, scales well and stays within the order of a second in all experiments performed on SuperMUC-NG, which uses a fat tree network. Using hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization, the onset of the MPI communication problem on Theta can be delayed. Further analysis of the performance of FROSch on large supercomputers with dragonfly interconnects will be necessary.},

However, this power rarely occurs for real world solar modules operating at mid-latitude locations. Therefore, contact layer thicknesses but also lateral grid patterns should be optimized for lower irradiation intensities. This results in material production savings for the grid and TCO layer of up to 50 % and simultaneously a significant gain in yield of over 1 % for regions with a low annual mean irradiation.},

It is robust with respect to large contrasts of the coefficients of the partial differential equations. The condition number bound of the new method is shown to be independent of the coefficient contrast and only dependent on a user-prescribed tolerance. The interface of the nonoverlapping domain decomposition is partitioned into nonoverlapping patches. The new coarse space is obtained by selecting a few eigenvectors of certain local eigenproblems which are defined on these patches. These eigenmodes are energy-minimally extended to the interior of the nonoverlapping subdomains and added to the coarse space. By using a new interface decomposition, the reduced-dimension adaptive GDSW overlapping Schwarz method usually has a smaller coarse space than existing GDSW and adaptive GDSW domain decomposition methods. A robust condition number estimate is proven for the new reduced-dimension adaptive GDSW method which is also valid for existing adaptive GDSW methods.

    abstract = {Numerical simulations of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets involve the solution of large-scale highly nonlinear systems of equations on complex shallow geometries. This work is concerned with the construction of Schwarz preconditioners for the solution of the associated tangent problems, which are challenging for solvers mainly because of the strong anisotropy of the meshes and wildly changing boundary conditions that can lead to poorly constrained problems on large portions of the domain. Here, two-level generalized Dryja--Smith--Widlund (GDSW)--type Schwarz preconditioners are applied to different land ice problems, i.e., a velocity problem, a temperature problem, as well as the coupling of the former two problems. We employ the message passing interface (MPI)--parallel implementation of multilevel Schwarz preconditioners provided by the package FROSch (fast and robust Schwarz) from the Trilinos library. The strength of the proposed preconditioner is that it yields out-of-the-box scalable and robust preconditioners for the single physics problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time two-level Schwarz preconditioners have been applied to the ice sheet problem and a scalable preconditioner has been used for the coupled problem. The preconditioner for the coupled problem differs from previous monolithic GDSW preconditioners in the sense that decoupled extension operators are used to compute the values in the interior of the subdomains. Several approaches for improving the performance, such as reuse strategies and shared memory OpenMP parallelization, are explored as well. In our numerical study we target both uniform meshes of varying resolution for the Antarctic ice sheet as well as nonuniform meshes for the Greenland ice sheet. We present several weak and strong scaling studies confirming the robustness of the approach and the parallel scalability of the FROSch implementation. Among the highlights of the numerical results are a weak scaling study for up to 32K processor cores (8K MPI ranks and 4 OpenMP threads) and 566M degrees of freedom for the velocity problem as well as a strong scaling study for up to 4K processor cores (and MPI ranks) and 68M degrees of freedom for the coupled problem.},

This approach yields very low prediction errors, in particular, when using the U-Net architecture. Furthermore, the models are also able to generalize to unseen geometries of the same type. A transfer learning approach enables the model to be trained to a new type of geometries with very low training cost.

Two well-known examples are the SIR and the SEIR models. The transition rates between the diﬀerent compartments are deﬁned by certain parameters which are speciﬁc for the respective virus. Often, these parameters can be taken from the literature or can be determined from statistics. However, the contact rate or the related eﬀective reproduction number are in general not constant and thus cannot easily be determined. Here, a new machine learning approach based on physics-informed neural networks is presented that can learn the contact rate from given data for the dynamical systems given by the SIR and SEIR models. The new method generalizes an already known approach for the identiﬁcation of constant parameters to the variable or time-dependent case. After introducing the new method, it is tested for synthetic data generated by the numerical solution of SIR and SEIR models. Here, the case of exact and perturbed data is considered. In all cases, the contact rate can be learned very satisfactorily. Finally, the SEIR model in combination with physics-informed neural networks is used to learn the contact rate for COVID-19 data given by the course of the epidemic in Germany. The simulation of the number of infected individuals over the course of the epidemic, using the learned contact rate, is very promising.},

Adaptive coarse spaces ensure robustness of highly scalable domain decomposition solvers, even for highly heterogeneous coefficient distributions with arbitrary coefficient jumps. However, their construction requires the setup and solution of local generalized eigenvalue problems, which is typically computationally expensive. The idea of ML-FETI-DP is to interpret the coefficient distribution as image data and predict whether an eigenvalue problem has to be solved or can be neglected while still maintaining robustness of the adaptive FETI-DP method. For this purpose, neural networks are used as image classifiers. In the present work, the ML-FETI-DP algorithm is extended to three dimensions, which requires both a complex data preprocessing procedure to construct consistent input data for the neural network as well as a representative training and validation data set to ensure generalization properties of the machine learning model. Numerical experiments for stationary diffusion and linear elasticity problems with realistic coefficient distributions show that a large number of eigenvalue problems can be saved; in the best case of the numerical results presented here, 97% of the eigenvalue problems can be avoided to be set up and solved.},

In order to reduce the number of eigenvalue problems and thus the computational cost, we use a neural network to predict the geometric location of critical edges, i.e., edges where the eigenvalue problem is indispensable. As input data for the neural network, we use function evaluations of the coefficient function within the two subdomains adjacent to an edge. In the present article, we examine the effect of computing the input data only in a neighborhood of the edge, i.e., on slabs next to the edge. We show numerical results for both the training data as well as for a concrete test problem in form of a microsection subsection for linear elasticity problems.

For second-order elliptic partial differential equations, coefficient discontinuities with a large contrast can lead to a deterioration of the convergence rate. Only by implementing an appropriate coarse space or second level, a robust domain decomposition method can be obtained. In this article, a new frugal coarse space for FETI-DP (Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting - Dual Primal) and BDDC (Balancing Domain Decomposition by Constraints) methods is presented, which has a lower set-up cost than competing adaptive coarse spaces. In particular, in contrast to adaptive coarse spaces, it does not require the solution of any local generalized eigenvalue problems. The approach considered here aims at a low-dimensional approximation of the adaptive coarse space by using appropriate weighted averages and is robust for a broad range of coefficient distributions for diffusion and elasticity problems. In this article, the robustness is heuristically justified as well as numerically shown for several coefficient distributions. The new coarse space is compared to adaptive coarse spaces, and parallel scalability up to 262,144 parallel cores for a parallel BDDC implementation with the new coarse space is shown. The superiority of the new coarse space over classic coarse spaces with respect to parallel weak scalability and time to solution is confirmed by numerical experiments.},

    abstract = {In recent years, nonlinear domain decomposition (DD) methods for the solution of nonlinear partial differential equations as, e.g., ASPIN (Additive Schwarz Preconditioned Inexact Newton) or Nonlinear-FETI-DP (Nonlinear - Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting - Dual-Primal), became popular. For several model problems, these approaches outperform classical inexact Newton methods, where a corresponding linear DD method is used to solve the linearized problems, in terms of linear and nonlinear iteration counts and time to solution. As in the linear case, in nonlinear DD methods, an appropriate coarse space is often necessary for robustness and numerical scalability. In this paper, a new multiplicative implementation of a coarse space for ASPIN as well as the related RASPEN (Restricted Additive Schwarz Preconditioned Exact Newton) method is suggested. Additionally, several coarse spaces, which are also applicable for unstructured meshes and domain decompositions, are suggested. Robustness and numerical scalability is shown for different homogeneous and heterogeneous p-Laplace problems in two spatial dimensions.},

    abstract = {Adaptive FETI-DP (Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting - Dual-Primal) methods are considered for the solution of two-dimensional scalar elliptic model problems with complex coefficient distributions where large coefficient jumps can occur along or across the domain decomposition interface. The adaptive coarse space is obtained by solving certain generalized eigenvalue problems on subdomain edges. In order to reduce the number of eigenvalue problems, a machine learning based strategy using a neural network to predict the geometric location of critical edges can be applied in a preprocessing step. Here, the effect of different types of training data sets on the robustness of the machine learning adaptive FETI-DP algorithm is investigated. Therefore, the neural network is first trained on different data sets and then the machine learning model is evaluated for a coefficient distribution obtained from a realistic dual-phase steel microstructure. It can be observed that the best results are obtained using a priori knowledge (smart data), whereas purely random data yields bad results. However, by imposing some structure on the random data and increasing the size of the data set, the performance is comparable to the smart data.},

    abstract = {Nonlinear domain decomposition (DD) methods, such as ASPIN (additive Schwarz preconditioned inexact Newton), RASPEN (restricted additive Schwarz preconditioned inexact Newton), nonlinear FETI-DP (finite element tearing and interconnecting-dual primal), and nonlinear BDDC (balancing DD by constraints), can be reasonable alternatives to classical Newton--Krylov-DD methods for the solution of sparse nonlinear systems of equations, e.g., arising from a discretization of a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE). These nonlinear DD approaches are often able to effectively tackle unevenly distributed nonlinearities and outperform Newton's method with respect to convergence speed as well as global convergence behavior. Furthermore, they often improve parallel scalability due to a superior ratio of local to global work. Nonetheless, as for linear DD methods, it is often necessary to incorporate an appropriate coarse space in a second level to obtain numerical scalability for increasing numbers of subdomains. In addition, an appropriate coarse space can also improve the nonlinear convergence of nonlinear DD methods. In this paper, we introduce four variants for integrating coarse spaces in nonlinear Schwarz methods in an additive or multiplicative way using Galerkin projections. These new variants can be interpreted as natural nonlinear equivalents to well-known linear additive and hybrid two-level Schwarz preconditioners. Furthermore, they facilitate the use of various coarse spaces, e.g., coarse spaces based on energy-minimizing extensions, which can easily be used for irregular DDs, such as, e.g., those obtained by graph partitioners. In particular, multiscale finite element method (MsFEM)-type coarse spaces are considered, and it is shown that they outperform classical approaches for certain heterogeneous nonlinear problems. The new approaches are then compared with classical Newton--Krylov-DD and nonlinear one-level Schwarz approaches for different homogeneous and heterogeneous model problems based on the $p$-Laplace operator.},

    abstract = {Summary Monolithic preconditioners for incompressible fluid flow problems can significantly improve the convergence speed compared with preconditioners based on incomplete block factorizations. However, the computational costs for the setup and the application of monolithic preconditioners are typically higher. In this article, several techniques are applied to monolithic two-level generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund (GDSW) preconditioners to further improve the convergence speed and the computing time. In particular, reduced dimension GDSW coarse spaces, restricted and scaled versions of the first level, hybrid, and parallel coupling of the levels, and recycling strategies are investigated. Using a combination of all these improvements, for a small time-dependent Navier-Stokes problem on 240 message passing interface (MPI) ranks, a reduction of 86\% of the time-to-solution can be obtained. Even without applying recycling strategies, the time-to-solution can be reduced by more than 50\% for a larger steady Stokes problem on 4608 MPI ranks. For the largest problems with 11â979 MPI ranks, the scalability deteriorates drastically for the monolithic GDSW coarse space. On the other hand, using the reduced dimension coarse spaces, good scalability up to 11â979 MPI ranks, which corresponds to the largest problem configuration fitting on the employed supercomputer, could be achieved.},

    abstract = {Domain decomposition methods are robust and parallel scalable, preconditioned iterative algorithms for the solution of the large linear systems arising in the discretization of elliptic partial differential equations by finite elements. The convergence rate of these methods is generally determined by the eigenvalues of the preconditioned system. For second-order elliptic partial differential equations, coefficient discontinuities with a large contrast can lead to a deterioration of the convergence rate. A remedy can be obtained by enhancing the coarse space with elements, which are often called constraints, that are computed by solving small eigenvalue problems on portions of the interface of the domain decomposition, i.e., edges in two dimensions or faces and edges in three dimensions. In the present work, without restriction of generality, the focus is on two dimensions. In general, it is difficult to predict where these constraints have to be added, and therefore the corresponding local eigenvalue problems have to be computed, i.e., on which edges. Here, a machine learning based strategy using neural networks is suggested to predict the geometric location of these edges in a preprocessing step. This reduces the number of eigenvalue problems that have to be solved before the iteration. Numerical experiments for model problems and realistic microsections using regular decompositions as well as decompositions from graph partitioners are provided, showing very promising results.},

While the convergence of standard coarse spaces may depend strongly on the contrast of the coefficient function, the condition number bound of the new method is independent of the coefficient function. Indeed, the condition number only depends on a user-prescribed tolerance. The coarse space is based on discrete harmonic extensions of vertex, edge, and face interface functions, which are computed from the solutions of corresponding local generalized edge and face eigenvalue problems. The local eigenvalue problems are of the size of the edges and faces of the decomposition, and the eigenvalue problems can be constructed solely from the local subdomain stiffness matrices and the fully assembled global stiffness matrix. The new AGDSW (adaptive generalized Dryja--Smith--Widlund) coarse space always contains the classical GDSW coarse space by construction of the generalized eigenvalue problems.

In particular, cases are considered where the problem cannot or should not be reduced using local static condensation, e.g., Stokes or Navier--Stokes problems with continuous pressure spaces. In the new monolithic preconditioners, the local overlapping problems and the coarse problem are saddle point problems with the same structure as the original problem. Our parallel implementation of these preconditioners is based on the fast and robust overlapping Schwarz (FROSch) library, which is part of the Trilinos package ShyLU. The implementation is essentially algebraic in the sense that, for the class of problems presented here, the preconditioners can be constructed from the fully assembled stiffness matrix and information about the block structure of the problem. Further information about the geometry or the null space of the underlying problem can improve the performance compared to the default settings. Parallel scalability results for several thousand cores for Stokes and Navier--Stokes model problems are reported. Each of the local problems is solved using a direct solver in serial mode, whereas the coarse problem is solved using a direct solver in serial or message passing interface (MPI)-parallel mode or using an MPI-parallel iterative Krylov solver.},

    abstract = {Two-level overlapping Schwarz domain decomposition methods for second-order elliptic problems in two dimensions are proposed using coarse spaces constructed from the Approximate Component Mode Synthesis (ACMS) multiscale discretization approach. These coarse spaces are based on eigenvalue problems using Schur complements on subdomain edges. It is then shown that the convergence of the resulting preconditioned Krylov method can be controlled by a user-specified tolerance and thus can be made independent of heterogeneities in the coefficient of the partial differential equation. The relations of this new approach to other known adaptive coarse space approaches for overlapping Schwarz methods are also discussed. Compared to one of the competing adaptive approaches, the new coarse space can be significantly smaller. Compared to other competing approaches, the eigenvalue problems are significantly cheaper to solve, i.e., the dimension of the eigenvalue problems is minimal among the competing adaptive approaches under consideration. Our local eigenvalue problems can be solved using one iteration of LobPCG for essentially the same cost as a Cholesky-decomposition of a Schur complement on a subdomain edge.},

In order to deal with the increasing complexity of the boundary value problem parallel computing and a two-level overlapping Schwarz method with energy-minimizing coarse space are applied; cf. [3].

    abstract = {Accurate simulations of transmural wall stresses in artherosclerotic coronary arteries may help to predict plaque rupture. Therefore, a robust and efficient numerical framework for Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) of the blood flow and the arterial wall has to be set up, and suitable material laws for the modeling of the fluid and the structural response have to be incorporated. In this thesis, monolithic coupling algorithms and corresponding monolithic preconditioners are used to simulate FSI using highly nonlinear anisotropic polyconvex hyperelastic and anisotropic viscoelastic material models for the arterial wall. An MPI-parallel FSI software from the LifeV library is coupled to the software FEAP in order to enable access to the structural material models implemented in FEAP. To define a benchmark test for highly nonlinear material models in FSI, a simple geometry corresponding to a section of an idealized coronary artery, suitable boundary conditions, and material parameters adapted to experimental data are used. In particular, the geometry is chosen to be nonsymmetric to make effects due to the anisotropy of the structure visible. An initialization phase and several heartbeats are simulated, and systematical studies with meshes of increasing refinement and different space discretizations are carried out. The results indicate that, for the highly nonlinear material models, piecewise quadratic or F-bar element discretizations lead to significantly better results than piecewise linear shape functions. The results using piecewise linear shape functions are less accurate with respect to the displacements and, in particular, to the approximation of the stresses. To improve the performance of the FSI simulations, a more robust preconditioner for the highly nonlinear structural material models has to be used. Therefore, a parallel implementation of the GDSW (Generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund) preconditioner, which is a geometric two-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioner with energy-minimizing coarse space, is presented. The implementation, which is based on the software library Trilinos, is held flexible to make further extensions of the preconditioner possible. Even though the dimension of its coarse space is comparably large, parallel scalability for two and three dimensional scalar elliptic and linear elastic problems for thousands of cores is demonstrated. Also for unstructured domain decompositions and for a hybrid version of the preconditioner, convincing scalability is presented. When used as a preconditioner for the structure block in FSI simulations, the GDSW preconditioner shows excellent performance as well: scalability for up to 512 cores and a significant reduction of the simulation time and of the number of iterations with respect to the previously used preconditioner, IFPACK, are observed. IFPACK is an algebraic one-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioner. Finally, highly heterogeneous (multiscale) problems are investigated. Since the GDSW coarse space is not robust for general problems of this type, spaces based on Approximate Component Mode Synthesis (ACMS) are considered. On the basis of the ACMS space, coarse spaces for overlapping Schwarz methods are constructed, and a parallel implementation of a special finite element method is presented. For the coarse spaces, preliminary results indicating numerical scalability and robustness are discussed. For the parallel implementation of the special finite element method, very good parallel weak scalability is observed with respect to the construction of the basis functions and to the solution of the resulting linear system using the FETI-DP (Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting - Dual Primal) method.},

One of the main contributions of this paper is the application of a highly nonlinear, polyconvex anisotropic structural model for the solid in the context of fluid-structure interaction, together with a suitable discretization. Additionally, the influence of viscoelasticity is investigated. The fluid-structure interaction problem is solved using a monolithic approach; that is, the nonlinear system is solved (after time and space discretizations) as a whole without splitting among its components. The linearized block systems are solved iteratively using parallel domain decomposition preconditioners. A simple but nonsymmetric curved geometry is proposed that is demonstrated to be suitable as a benchmark testbed for fluid-structure interaction simulations in biomechanics where nonlinear structural models are used. Based on the curved benchmark geometry, the influence of different material models, spatial discretizations, and meshes of varying refinement is investigated. It turns out that often-used standard displacement elements with linear shape functions are not sufficient to provide good approximations of the arterial wall stresses, whereas for standard displacement elements or F-bar formulations with quadratic shape functions, suitable results are obtained. For the time discretization, a second-order backward differentiation formula scheme is used. It is shown that the curved geometry enables the analysis of non-rotationally symmetric distributions of the mechanical fields. For instance, the maximal shear stresses in the fluidâstructure interface are found to be higher in the inner curve that corresponds to clinical observations indicating a high plaque nucleation probability at such locations.},

    abbr = {CMAME},
    abstract = {Randomized neural networks (RaNNs), in which hidden layers remain fixed after random initialization, provide an efficient alternative for parameter optimization compared to fully parameterized networks. In this paper, RaNNs are integrated with overlapping Schwarz domain decomposition in two (main) ways: first, to formulate the least-squares problem with localized basis functions, and second, to construct overlapping preconditioners for the resulting linear systems. In particular, neural networks are initialized randomly in each subdomain based on a uniform distribution and linked through a partition of unity, forming a global solution that approximates the solution of the partial differential equation. Boundary conditions are enforced through a constraining operator, eliminating the need for a penalty term to handle them. Principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce the number of basis functions in each subdomain, yielding a linear system with a lower condition number. By constructing additive and restricted additive Schwarz preconditioners, the least-squares problem is solved efficiently using the Conjugate Gradient (CG) and Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) methods, respectively. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces computational time for multi-scale and time-dependent problems. Additionally, a three-dimensional problem is presented to demonstrate the efficiency of using the CG method with an AS preconditioner, compared to an QR decomposition, in solving the least-squares problem.},

    abstract = {The segmentation of ultra-high resolution images poses challenges such as loss of spatial information or computational inefficiency. In this work, a novel approach that combines encoder-decoder architectures with domain decomposition strategies to address these challenges is proposed. Specifically, a domain decomposition-based U-Net (DDU-Net) architecture is introduced, which partitions input images into non-overlapping patches that can be processed independently on separate devices. A communication network is added to facilitate inter-patch information exchange to enhance the understanding of spatial context. Experimental validation is performed on a synthetic dataset that is designed to measure the effectiveness of the communication network. Then, the performance is tested on the DeepGlobe land cover classification dataset as a real-world benchmark data set. The results demonstrate that the approach, which includes inter-patch communication for images divided into 16x16 non-overlapping subimages, achieves a 2-3% higher intersection over union (IoU) score compared to the same network without inter-patch communication. The performance of the network which includes communication is equivalent to that of a baseline U-Net trained on the full image, showing that our model provides an effective solution for segmenting ultra-high-resolution images while preserving spatial context.

    year = {2024},
    month = {November},
    abbr = {SISC},
    abstract = {Two-level domain decomposition preconditioners lead to fast convergence and scalability of iterative solvers. However, for highly heterogeneous problems, where the coefficient function is varying rapidly on several possibly non-separated scales, the condition number of the preconditioned system generally depends on the contrast of the coefficient function leading to a deterioration of convergence. Enhancing the methods by coarse spaces constructed from suitable local eigenvalue problems, also denoted as adaptive or spectral coarse spaces, restores robust, contrast-independent convergence. However, these eigenvalue problems typically rely on non-algebraic information, such that the adaptive coarse spaces cannot be constructed from the fully assembled system matrix. In this paper, a novel algebraic adaptive coarse space, which relies on the a-orthogonal decomposition of (local) finite element (FE) spaces into functions that solve the partial differential equation (PDE) with some trace and FE functions that are zero on the boundary, is proposed. In particular, the basis is constructed from eigenmodes of two types of local eigenvalue problems associated with the edges of the domain decomposition. To approximate functions that solve the PDE locally, we employ a transfer eigenvalue problem, which has originally been proposed for the construction of optimal local approximation spaces for multiscale methods. In addition, we make use of a Dirichlet eigenvalue problem that is a slight modification of the Neumann eigenvalue problem used in the adaptive generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund (AGDSW) coarse space. Both eigenvalue problems rely solely on local Dirichlet matrices, which can be extracted from the fully assembled system matrix. By combining arguments from multiscale and domain decomposition methods we derive a contrast-independent upper bound for the condition number. The robustness of the method is confirmed numerically for a variety of heterogeneous coefficient distributions, including binary random distributions and a coefficient function constructed from the SPE10 benchmark. The results are comparable to those of the non-algebraic AGDSW coarse space, also for those cases where the convergence of the classical algebraic generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund (GDSW) coarse space deteriorates. Moreover, the coarse space dimension is the same or comparable to the AGDSW coarse space for all numerical experiments.},

To improve the performance of PINNs for time-dependent problems, a combination of multifidelity stacking PINNs and domain decomposition-based finite basis PINNs is employed. In particular, to learn the high-fidelity part of the multifidelity model, a domain decomposition in time is employed. The performance is investigated for a pendulum and a two-frequency problem as well as the Allen-Cahn equation. It can be observed that the domain decomposition approach clearly improves the PINN and stacking PINN approaches.

    abstract = {Approximate solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) obtained by neural networks are highly affected by hyper parameter settings. For instance, the model training strongly depends on loss function design, including the choice of weight factors for different terms in the loss function, and the sampling set related to numerical integration; other hyper parameters, like the network architecture and the optimizer settings, also impact the model performance. On the other hand, suitable hyper parameter settings are known to be different for different model problems and currently no universal rule for the choice of hyper parameters is known. In this paper, for second order elliptic model problems, various hyper parameter settings are tested numerically to provide a practical guide for efficient and accurate neural network approximation. While a full study of all possible hyper parameter settings is not possible, we focus on studying the formulation of the PDE loss as well as the incorporation of the boundary conditions, the choice of collocation points associated with numerical integration schemes, and various approaches for dealing with loss imbalances will be extensively studied on various model problems; in addition to various Poisson model problems, also a nonlinear and an eigenvalue problem are considered.},

    title = {PACMANN: Point Adaptive Collocation Method for Artificial Neural Networks},
    year = {2024},
    month = {November},
    abstract = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are an emerging tool for approximating the solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in both forward and inverse problems. PINNs minimize a loss function which includes the PDE residual determined for a set of collocation points. Previous work has shown that the number and distribution of these collocation points have a significant influence on the accuracy of the PINN solution. Therefore, the effective placement of these collocation points is an active area of research. Specifically, adaptive collocation point sampling methods have been proposed, which have been reported to scale poorly to higher dimensions. In this work, we address this issue and present the Point Adaptive Collocation Method for Artificial Neural Networks (PACMANN). Inspired by classic optimization problems, this approach incrementally moves collocation points toward regions of higher residuals using gradient-based optimization algorithms guided by the gradient of the squared residual. We apply PACMANN for forward and inverse problems, and demonstrate that this method matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods in terms of the accuracy/efficiency tradeoff for the low-dimensional problems, while outperforming available approaches for high-dimensional problems; the best performance is observed for the Adam optimizer. Key features of the method include its low computational cost and simplicity of integration in existing physics-informed neural network pipelines.},

    title = {Deep operator network models for predicting post-burn contraction},
    year = {2024},
    month = {November},
    abstract = {Burn injuries present a significant global health challenge. Among the most severe long-term consequences are contractures, which can lead to functional impairments and disfigurement. Understanding and predicting the evolution of post-burn wounds is essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Traditional mathematical models, while accurate, are often computationally expensive and time-consuming, limiting their practical application. Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly in deep learning, offer promising alternatives for accelerating these predictions. This study explores the use of a deep operator network (DeepONet), a type of neural operator, as a surrogate model for finite element simulations, aimed at predicting post-burn contraction across multiple wound shapes. A DeepONet was trained on three distinct initial wound shapes, with enhancement made to the architecture by incorporating initial wound shape information and applying sine augmentation to enforce boundary conditions. The performance of the trained DeepONet was evaluated on a test set including finite element simulations based on convex combinations of the three basic wound shapes. The model achieved an $R^2$ score of $0.99$, indicating strong predictive accuracy and generalization. Moreover, the model provided reliable predictions over an extended period of up to one year, with speedups of up to 128-fold on CPU and 235-fold on GPU, compared to the numerical model. These findings suggest that DeepONets can effectively serve as a surrogate for traditional finite element methods in simulating post-burn wound evolution, with potential applications in medical treatment planning.},

    year = {2025},
    month = {April},
    abstract = {During the COVID-19 crisis, mechanistic models have been proven fundamental to guide evidence-based decision making. However, time-critical decisions in a dynamically changing environment restrict  the time available for modelers to gather supporting evidence. As infectious disease dynamics are often heterogeneous on a spatial or demographic scale, models should be resolved accordingly. In addition, with a large number of potential interventions, all scenarios can barely be computed on time, even when using supercomputing facilities. We suggest to combine complex mechanistic models with data-driven surrogate models to allow for on-the-fly model adaptations by public health experts. We build upon a spatially and demographically resolved infectious disease model and train a graph neural network for data sets representing early phases of the pandemic. The resulting networks reached an execution time of less than a second, a significant speedup compared to the metapopulation approach. The suggested approach yields potential for on-the-fly execution and, thus, integration of disease dynamics models in low-barrier website applications. For the approach to be used with decision-making, datasets with larger variance will have to be considered.},

    abstract = {The computational complexity and efficiency of the approximate mode component synthesis (ACMS) method is investigated for the two-dimensional heterogeneous Helmholtz equations, aiming at the simulation of large but finite-size photonic crystals. The ACMS method is a Galerkin method that relies on a non-overlapping domain decomposition and special basis functions defined based on the domain decomposition. While, in previous works, the ACMS method was realized using first-order finite elements, we use an underlying hp–finite element method. We study the accuracy of the ACMS method for different wavenumbers, domain decompositions, and discretization parameters. Moreover, the computational complexity of the method is investigated theoretically and compared with computing times for an implementation based on the open source software package NGSolve. The numerical results indicate that, for relevant wavenumber regimes, the size of the resulting linear systems for the ACMS method remains moderate, such that sparse direct solvers are a reasonable choice. Moreover, the ACMS method exhibits only a weak dependence on the selected domain decomposition, allowing for greater flexibility in its choice. Additionally, the numerical results show that the error of the ACMS method achieves the predicted convergence rate for increasing wavenumbers. Finally, to display the versatility of the implementation, the results of simulations of large but finite-size photonic crystals with defects are presented.},

Several numerical experiments in two and three spatial dimensions confirm the performance of the preconditioners as well as the {\frosch}-{\dealii} interface. In conclusion, the overall software interface is straightforward and easy to use while giving satisfactory solver performances for challenging PDE systems.},

One of the key to these properties is the construction of the coarse space used to solve a global coupling problem, which traditionally requires information about the underlying discretization. An algebraic formulation of the coarse space reduces the complexity of its assembly. Furthermore, well-chosen coarse basis functions within this space can better represent changes in the problem's properties. Here we introduce an algebraic formulation of the multiscale finite element method (MsFEM) based on the algebraic multiscale solver (AMS) in the context of the two-level Schwarz method. We show how AMS is related to other energy-minimizing coarse spaces. Furthermore, we compare the AMS with other algebraic energy-minimizing spaces: the generalized Dryja--Smith--Widlund (GDSW), and the reduced dimension GDSW (RGDSW).},

    abstract = {For the robustness and numerical scalability of domain decomposition-based linear solvers, the incorporation of a coarse level, which provides global transport of information, is crucial. State-of-the-art spectral, or adaptive, methods can generate the basis functions of the coarse space, which are adapted to the specific properties of the target problem, and yield provably robust convergence for certain classes of problems. However, their construction is computationally expensive and requires non-algebraic information. To improve the practicability of the solver, in this paper, we design a hierarchical math-informed local Graph Neural Network (GNN) to generate effective coarse-space basis functions. Our GNN uses only the local subdomain matrices available as the input to the algebraic linear solvers. This approach has several advantages including: 1) it is algebraic; 2) it is local and therefore as scalable as the classical domain decomposition solvers; and 3) the cost for training, inference, and generating data sets is much lower than that needed for approaches relying on the global matrix. To study the potential of our GNN architecture, we present numerical results with homogeneous and heterogeneous problems.},

    month = {June},
    abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of viscous fluids described by the Navier--Stokes equations are considered. Depending on the Reynolds number of the flow, the Navier--Stokes equations may exhibit a highly nonlinear behavior. The system of nonlinear equations resulting from the discretization of the Navier--Stokes equations can be solved using nonlinear iteration methods, such as Newton's method. However, fast quadratic convergence is typically only obtained in a local neighborhood of the solution, and for many configurations, the classical Newton iteration does not converge at all. In such cases, so-called globalization techniques may help to improve convergence. In this paper, pseudo-transient continuation is employed in order to improve nonlinear convergence. The classical algorithm is enhanced by a neural network model that is trained to predict a local pseudo-time step. Generalization of the novel approach is facilitated by predicting the local pseudo-time step separately on each element using only local information on a patch of adjacent elements as input. Numerical results for standard benchmark problems, including flow through a backward facing step geometry and Couette flow, show the performance of the machine learning-enhanced globalization approach; as the software for the simulations, the CFD module of COMSOL Multiphysics® is employed.},
