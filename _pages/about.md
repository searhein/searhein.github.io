Alexander Heinlein is substitute professor at the <a href="https://www.ians.uni-stuttgart.de/nmh/" target="_blank">Chair of Numerical Mathematics for High Performance Computing (NMH)</a> of the <a href="https://www.ians.uni-stuttgart.de" target="_blank">Institute of Applied Analysis and Numerical Simulation (IANS)</a> at the <a href="https://www.uni-stuttgart.de" target="_blank">University of Stuttgart</a>.

His main research areas are **numerical methods for partial differential equations** and **scientific computing**, in particular, solvers and discretizations based on **domain decomposition and multiscale approaches**. He is interested in **high-performance computing (HPC)** and solving challenging problems involving, e.g., complex geometries, highly heterogenous coefficient functions, or the coupling of multiple physics. More recently, Alexander also started focusing on the combination of scientific computing and machine learning, a new research area also known as **scientific machine learning (SciML)**. Generally, his work includes the development of new methods and their theoretical foundation as well as their implementation on **current computer architectures (CPUs, GPUs)** and application to real world problems.
