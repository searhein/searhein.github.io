Scientific machine learning is a new, rapidly developing field of research in which techniques of scientific computing and machine learning are combined and further developed. This results in hybrid methods which are applied for the discretization of partial differential equations, the development of fast and robust solvers and new modeling techniques.

Current research topics are:

+ Domain decomposition methods using machine learning
+ Flow predictions using convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
+ Parameter identification using physics-informed networks (PINNs)
