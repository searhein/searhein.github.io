The [**Workshop on Computational and Mathematical Methods in Data Science 2024**](https://searhein.github.io/gamm-cominds-2024/) was organized at the Delft University of Technology on April 25 & 26, 2024 with financial support of the [4TU Applied Mathematics Institute (AMI)](https://www.4tu.nl/ami/) and the [TU Delft Institute for Computational Science and Engineering (DCSE)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tu-delft-institute-for-computational-science-and-engineering). The workshop was

+ a meeting of the [Strategic Research Initiative “Bridging Numerical Analysis and Machine Learning”](https://www.4tu.nl/ami/Research/sri-bridgingNAML/) of the [4TU Applied Mathematics Institute (AMI)](https://www.4tu.nl/ami/),
+ the 2024 edition of the annual workshop of the [GAMM Activity Group on “Computational and Mathematical Methods in Data Science” (COMinDS)](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/mathematik/wire/cominds/), and
+ the first activity of the new [EMS Topical Activity Group Scientific Machine Learning](https://ems-tag-sciml.github.io/).

Most parts of the workshop took place in the Collegezaal in the DUWO building, which is managed by the [Vakwerkhuis](https://vakwerkhuis.com/), just next to the campus of TU Delft. For the poster session, the participants moved to the Betazaal next door, and the conference dinner took place at [Moodz eten & drinken](https://www.moodzdelft.nl/).

With **45 participants**, **4 keynote presentations** by [Christoph Brune (University of Twente)](https://people.utwente.nl/c.brune), [Victorita Dolean (TU Eindhoven)](http://www.victoritadolean.com/), [Olga Mula (TU Eindhoven)](https://omula.gitlab.io/) , and [Thomas Richter (Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg)](https://numerics.ovgu.de/), **10 contributed talks**, and **10 poster presentations**, the technical program was very rich and covered many aspects of computational and mathematical methods in data science; the full program can be found [here](https://searhein.github.io/gamm-cominds-2024/). There were many lively discussions after the talks, in the breaks, as well as at the poster session during the Thursday's lunch break. Among many topics, **scientific machine learning** was the dominant themes throughout the workshop.

Part of the program were presentations of the [Strategic Research Initiative “Bridging Numerical Analysis and Machine Learning”](https://www.4tu.nl/ami/Research/sri-bridgingNAML/) of the [4TU Applied Mathematics Institute (AMI)](https://www.4tu.nl/ami/) and the new [EMS Topical Activity Group Scientific Machine Learning](https://ems-tag-sciml.github.io/) as well as the business meeting of the [GAMM Activity Group on “Computational and Mathematical Methods in Data Science” (COMinDS)](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/mathematik/wire/cominds/). At the business meeting, [Martin Stoll](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/mathematik/wire/prof.php) volunteered to organize next year's edition of the annual workshop of the [GAMM Activity Group on “Computational and Mathematical Methods in Data Science” (COMinDS)](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/mathematik/wire/cominds/) at [TU Chemnitz](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/index.html.en).
