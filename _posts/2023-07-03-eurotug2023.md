This years' **[European Trilinos User Group Meeting (EuroTUG2023)](https://eurotug.github.io/)** took place on June 28-30, 2023 on the **campus of [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl/en/)**. After the EuroTUG meeting series resumed from a three-year break with an online edition last year, this years meeting was the first in-person EuroTUG meeting after the coronavirus pandemic. With **more than 30 participants from various European universities** as well as **[Trilinos](https://trilinos.github.io) developers Luc Berger-Vergiat and Nathan Roberts from the Sandia National Laboratories** and **Kokkos co-lead Damien Lebrun-Grandie from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory**, the meeting was a complete success.

On the first day, the programme started with **hands-on tutorials for beginners** which were already well-attended and -received by the participants of the meeting. On the second and third day, the programme consisted of **Trilinos developer talks** with updates on selected product areas of Trilinos, **user talks** on use cases for and developments of Trilinos from the European community, as well as **Kokkos tutorials**. One highlight of the meeting was the **keynote on High-Performance Computing at TU Delft** given by [Kees Vuik](http://ta.twi.tudelft.nl/users/vuik/). The programme concluded with an open **roundtable discussion among all participants** on topics such as "shaping a European Trilinos community", "how to contribute to Trilinos", "accessibility of Trilinos", and "maintenance of Trilinos". More details on the programme can be found on the [website of the meeting](https://eurotug.github.io/). During the breaks, the **conference dinner**, as well as after the official end of the programme there were lively discussions and an exchange of ideas and opinions.

The meeting was supported by the [TU Delft Institute for Computational Science and Engineering (DCSE)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tu-delft-institute-for-computational-science-and-engineering) and the [Delft High Performance Computing Centre (DHPC)](https://www.tudelft.nl/dhpc). It has been jointly organized by by [Alexander Heinlein (TU Delft, local organizer)](https://searhein.github.io/) and [Matthias Mayr (UniBw M)](https://www.unibw.de/imcs/team/mayr).
